# New Public Galaxy Servers

No [new publicly accessible Galaxy servers](../../PublicGalaxyServers) were added to [the list](../../PublicGalaxyServers) in May.  To make up for this sad state of affairs, we created the ...

<a href='https://launch.genome.edu.au/launch'><img src='/PublicGalaxyServers/GenomicsVirtualLab300.png' alt='GVL' width="80" /></a> &nbsp; <a href='https://galaxy.plgrid.pl'><img src='/SemiPublicGalaxyServers/PL-Grid_Logo.png' alt='PL-Grid Galaxy' width="80" /></a><br />

</div></div>

## New Semi-Public Galaxy Servers Directory

The [Semi-Public Galaxy Servers Directory](/SemiPublicGalaxyServers) lists Galaxy servers that aren't [fully publicly accessible](../../PublicGalaxyServers), but that are accessible to a larger group than just the host institution's members.  (Most Galaxy instances are *internal* to an organization - they can only be accessed by members of the host institution.)

Servers are classified by whom they are accessible to.  This can be based on [research domain](/SemiPublicGalaxyServers#domain-based), [Geography Based|geography (regional or national)](/SemiPublicGalaxyServers), or by [membership in a multi-organization association](/SemiPublicGalaxyServers#association-based) that provides Galaxy Servers. 

**To add your semi-public Galaxy server to this list**, please either just add it (hey, *it's a wiki*), or [describe the server here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14i8FNHB7pwXrXmhvUkxXTh2VKQ-2BKsnMubXsCZadjs/viewform) and we'll post it this directory.

# Releases

## Galaxy v16.04

<div class='right'><a href='http://getgalaxy.org'><img src='/Images/Logos/GalaxyNewLogo_GalaxyProject_Trans.png' alt='GalaxyProject' width="200" /></a></div>
 
The [Galaxy Committers team](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/organization.rst) is pleased to announce the **[April 2016 (v16.04) release of Galaxy](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/16.04_announce.html)**.

*Please note that Python 2.6 is no longer supported as of this release. See the [16.04 release announcement](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/News/2016_04_GalaxyRelease) for details.*

<span style="font-size: larger;"> **Highlights** </span>

**Tool Profile Versions**

Tools may now [declare which version](http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/galaxy_changelog.html#tool-profile-version-pr-1688) of Galaxy they require. Tools requiring 16.04 or newer will have new default behaviors (such as using exit code for error detection) that should simplify tool development. See [PR #1688](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/1688).

**Embedded Pulsar Job Runner**

Galaxy can now start a Pulsar application embedded within the Galaxy process itself. This allows using Pulsar’s job staging and isolation without requiring a RESTful web service or a message queue. This is enabling usegalaxy.org to run jobs to on the new [JetStream cloud](http://jetstream-cloud.org/). See [PR #2057](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2057).

**New Chemical Datatypes**

Galaxy now detects and supports many molecular datatypes. See [PR 1941](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/1941). Thanks to [Björn Grüning (@bgruening)](https://github.com/bgruening).

### Galaxy Docker Image 16.04

And, thanks to [Björn Grüning](https://github.com/bgruening), there is also now [a Docker image for Galaxy 16.04](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/releases/tag/16.04) as well.  

## CloudMan 16.04

<div class='right'><a href='/CloudMan'><img src='/Images/GalaxyLogos/cloudman-logo.jpg' alt='CloudMan' width="300" /></a></div>

**We just released an update to Galaxy !CloudMan on AWS.** CloudMan offers an easy way to get a personal and completely functional instance of Galaxy in the cloud in just a few minutes, without any manual configuration or imposed quotas. Once running, you have complete control over Galaxy, including the ability to install new tools.

This is a minor update release with the following changes:
* Galaxy 16.04 update
* Availability on Amazon's Ireland region 
* A couple of bug fixes




See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudman/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a more complete set of changes.

<div class='right'><br /><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/'><img src='/Images/Logos/PlanemoLogo.png' alt='' width="200" /></a></div>

## Planemo 0.25.0 - 0.26.0

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  There was a lot of activity in the May releases of Planemo. Some highlights: 

* Implement `Engine` and `Runnable` abstractions - Planemo now has beta support for testing Galaxy workflows and CWL tools with Galaxy and any CWL artifact with [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/). [Pull Request 454](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/pull/454), [7be1bf5](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/7be1bf5)
* Introduce profile commands (`profile_create, profile_delete`, and `profile_list`) and profile improvements (automatic postgres database creation support). [Pull Request 480](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/pull/480), [a87899b](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/a87899b)
* Rework Galaxy test reporting to use structured data instead of XUnit data. [4d29bf1](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/4d29bf1)
* Refactor Galaxy configuration toward support for running Galaxy in docker-galaxy-stable. [Pull Request 479](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/pull/479)
* Implement Galaxy "profiles" - the ability to configure perisistent, named environments for `serve` and `test`. [5d08b67](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/5d08b67)
* Greatly improved `serve` command - make `test-data` available as an FTP folder, (on 16.07) automatically log in an admin user, and many more options (such as those required for "profiles" and a `--daemon` mode).
* Target draft 3 of [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org/) instead of draft 2. [775bf49](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/775bf49)
* Add IUC standards to Planemo docs. [2ae2b49](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/2ae2b49)
* Revise command-line handling framework for consistency and extension - allow extra options to be configured as defaults `~/.planemo.yml` including `--job_config_file` and conda configuration options. [e769118](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/e769118), [26e378e](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/commit/26e378e)

## Earlier Releases

<div class='right'><br /><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/'><img src='/Images/GalaxyLogos/pulsar_transparent.png' alt='Pulsar' width="150" /></a></div>

**Pulsar 0.7.0**

[Pulsar 0.7](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) was released in April.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.


**!CloudBridge 0.1.0**

The Galaxy Team is proud to be part of the development team for a new cross-cloud library called !CloudBridge. *!CloudBridge is a Python library providing a simple layer of abstraction over different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write conditional code for each cloud.* The library is generally applicable to any domain wishing to run cloud-independent applications. There is already support for Amazon and !OpenStack clouds with support for Google’s Compute Engine in development. 

The first version of !CloudBridge was released earlier this month and it comes with [detailed user documentation](http://cloudbridge.readthedocs.org/). The source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge).



**Starforge 0.1**

<div class='right'>
<a href='https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge/blob/master/README.rst'><img src='/Images/GalaxyLogos/starforge_logo_big.png' alt='Starforge' width="180" /></a>
</div>

[Starforge](https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge/blob/master/README.rst) is a collection of scripts that supports the building of components for Galaxy.  Specifically, with Starforge you can:

* Build [Galaxy Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) dependencies
* Build [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) (e.g. for the [Galaxy Wheels Server](http://wheels.galaxyproject.org/))
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems.

Documentation can be found at [starforge.readthedocs.org](http://starforge.readthedocs.org/). 


**!BioBlend 0.7.0**

   [BioBlend version 0.7.0](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend/) was released at the beginning of November. !BioBlend is a python library for interacting with CloudMan and the [Galaxy API](/Learn/API).  CloudMan offers an easy way to get a personal and completely functional instance of Galaxy in the cloud in just a few minutes, without any manual configuration.)  From the [release CHANGELOG](http://bit.ly/bbCHANGELOG).


**blend4j v0.1.2**
   [blend4j v0.1.2](https://github.com/jmchilton/blend4j) was released in December 2014.  blend4j is a JVM partial reimplemenation of the Python library bioblend for interacting with Galaxy, CloudMan, and !BioCloudCentral.
