This is [an entry](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/installing-annovar-in-galaxy.html) in Peter Briggs' [Galactic Engineer Blog](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/).

From [2015/03: Installing ANNOVAR in Galaxy](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/installing-annovar-in-galaxy.html):

 ANNOVAR (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/) is a popular tool used to functionally annotate genetic variants detected from various genomes. The Galaxy toolshed includes a tool called [table_annovar](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/table_annovar) which can be used to run ANNOVAR. Installation of the tool into a local Galaxy instance is not fully automated and requires some manual steps which are sketched in the tool's README; this post expands on those basic instructions to hopefully make the process easier for others.
