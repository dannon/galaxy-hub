This is the [first entry](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/ftp-upload-to-galaxy-using-proftpd-and.html) in Peter Briggs' [Galactic Engineer Blog](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/).

From the [intro](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/ftp-upload-to-galaxy-using-proftpd-and.html):

 The Galaxy documentation for integrating an FTP upload server can be found at https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Config/UploadviaFTP, and I've been working with their recommended choice of [ProFTPd](http://www.proftpd.org/). Overall the instructions are pretty straightforward, but I've encountered a few issues, mostly to do with Galaxy's change from SHA1 to PBKDF2 as its default choice of password authentication. This post details how I handled these to get the upload working.
