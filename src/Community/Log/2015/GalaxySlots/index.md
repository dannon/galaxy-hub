This is [an entry](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/using-galaxyslots-for-multithreaded_22.html) in Peter Briggs' [Galactic Engineer Blog](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/).

From [2015/04: Using GALAXY_SLOTS with multithreaded Galaxy tools](http://galacticengineer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/using-galaxyslots-for-multithreaded_22.html):

 GALAXY_SLOTS is a useful but not particularly well-publicised way of controlling the number of threads Galaxy allocates to a tool that supports multithreaded operation. It's relevant to both Galaxy admins (who need to ensure that multithreaded jobs don't try to consume more resources than they have access to) and to tool developers (who need to know how many threads are available to a tool at runtime).
