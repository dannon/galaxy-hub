From the [blog post](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~cassidy/wordpress/2015/10/21/galaxy-tool-generating-datasets/):

 As part of the [Alveo](http://alveo.edu.au/) project we’ve been using the Galaxy Workflow Engine to provide a web-based user-friendly interface to some language processing tools. ...<br /><br />
 One of the recent updates to Galaxy is the ability to group data objects together into datasets. These datasets can then form the input to a workflow which can be run for each object in the dataset.  This is something we’ve wanted for Alveo for a long time since applying the same process to all files in a collection is a common requirement for language processing.   *After a bit of exploration I’ve worked out [how to write a tool that generates a dataset](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~cassidy/wordpress/2015/10/21/galaxy-tool-generating-datasets/) and since the documentation for this is somewhat sparse and confusing, I thought I’d write up my findings.*
