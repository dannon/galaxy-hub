For Our Health - as Canadaâ€™s leading public health infectious disease laboratory, the [National Microbiology Laboratory (NML)](https://www.nml-lnm.gc.ca/index-eng.htm) is responsible for the identification, control and prevention of infectious diseases.

The NML is located at the [Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Science_Centre_for_Human_and_Animal_Health) in Winnipeg, the first facility in the world to have high containment laboratories for human and animal health in one building. It is recognized as a leader in an elite group of centres around the world, equipped with laboratories ranging from biosafety level 2 to level 4 designed to accommodate the most basic to the most deadly infectious organisms.

The NML is Canada's main infectious disease public health laboratory with responsibility for reference microbiology and quality assurance, laboratory surveillance for infectious diseases, emergency outbreak preparedness and response, training, and research and development.

Galaxy has been deployed at the NML since 2010, gaining further traction in 2012, and hitting 100,000 jobs per month in 2016.
