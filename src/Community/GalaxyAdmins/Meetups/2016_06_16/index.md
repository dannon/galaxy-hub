## Galaxy in Production at the University of Minnesota

</div>

Galaxy has been deployed in several contexts by the [Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI)](https://www.msi.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota - Twin Citites](https://www.umn.edu/).  This month [Evan Bollig](https://www.msi.umn.edu/staff/evan) and [JJ Johnson](https://www.msi.umn.edu/staff/jj) of MSI will discuss several aspects of this work relevant to the GalaxyAdmins group:

* customizations made to Galaxy that enable MSI to leverage it as a [Tier I service](https://www.msi.umn.edu/services) for our users (e.g., scheduling, quotas, billing, and sharing).
* [Pulsar](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar) for [Galaxy-P](https://usegalaxyp.org/) tools on Windows.
* the [CLIA-certified](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/IVDRegulatoryAssistance/ucm124105.htm) pipelines and how Galaxy is integrated into clinical workflows

## Galaxy Radio Telescope

[The GRT](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2455) aims to collect job run information from Galaxy servers that opt into the process.

Galaxy Admins can sign in to the GRT, register their Galaxy servers, and get back API keys per-Galaxy instance. Then they set up a cron job (preferably weekly, but we may explore options here later), and submit job data to the GRT.



## MSI Login Screens

And there was a question about MSI login screens during the presentation by Evan and JJ.  Here are two screenshots:

## Call Technology

<div class='right'>![April 2015 GalaxyAdmina Meetup, Online Conference Room](../../../../Images/Logos/AdobeConnectSquarish.jpg)</div>

The  meetup's online conference room will open 15 minutes before the meetup.  The call will use [Johns Hopkins' Adobe Connect server](http://connect.johnshopkins.edu/welcome/), which in turn uses Adobe Flash.  You are encouraged to connect a few minutes early to work out any unexpected bumps.

### Instructions for Participants

* You can ask questions either by *raising your hand* or by typing the question in the chat box.  
  * If you raise your hand, the host will need to recognize you.
  * If you ask a question verbally, please wear headphones.  Not wearing headphones lead to unpleasant feedback.
