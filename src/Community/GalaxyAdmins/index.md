*Galaxy-Admins* is a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for large Galaxy installations.  

Galaxy-Admins was started with [this email thread in April 2012](http://dev.list.galaxyproject.org/Interested-in-speaking-with-other-institutions-deploying-Galaxy-locally-td4593471.html). This proposal got a [huge response](http://dev.list.galaxyproject.org/Interested-in-speaking-with-other-institutions-deploying-Galaxy-locally-td4593471.html), and thus this group was born.

## Meetups

The group [meets](/src/Community/GalaxyAdmins/Meetups/index.md) the third Thursday of every two month (starting February) unless otherwise notified, and irregularly at [Galaxy-related events](/src/Events/index.md), such as [GCC2016](https://gcc2016.iu.edu/).
