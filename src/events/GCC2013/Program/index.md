The [2013 Galaxy Community Conference](/src/events/GCC2013/index.md) will start with a [Training Day](../TrainingDay) on 30 June, followed by two full days of accepted talks, keynotes, [lightning talks](../Lightning), [poster sessions](/Events/GCC2013/Abstracts#poster-abstracts), [birds-of-a-feather sessions](/src/events/GCC2013/BoF/index.md), and networking time.

As in past years, talks will cover a wide range of biology, bioinformatics, and informatics.  However, unlike in previous years, talks will be grouped and scheduled in sessions focusing on particular topics.

The [GCC2013 Training Day](/src/events/GCC2013/TrainingDay/index.md) will be Sunday, 30 June, and feature ~~four~~ *five* parallel tracks, each with three workshops, each of which are two hours long, for a total of ~~twelve~~ *fifteen* sessions on twelve different topics.  Sessions are evenly split between topics aimed at biological research, topics aimed at Galaxy deployers and developers, and those that are geared twoards both audiences.  The topics were nominated and selected by the Galaxy Community in early 2013. The increased number of parallel tracks and topics was driven by unexpected demand.

Workshops will be hands-on and participants will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along.
