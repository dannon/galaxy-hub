There is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to meet and learn from others doing high-throughput biology.  GCC2014 will continue this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing))* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.

BoF meetups are encouraged throughout GCC2014.  We particularly want to encourage !BoFs that flock at the end of each day, when time and space have been allocated for them.

## BoF Support

The conference *enables and encourages* !BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize !BoFs
* Use this wiki page as a hub for !BoFs at GCC2014.
* Promote !BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference ~~until everyone actually grows feathers~~.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for !BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.
