After the big success of the [first Swiss Galaxy Workshop](/Events/Switzerland2012) and the [second Swiss Galaxy Workshop](/src/Events/Switzerland2014/index.md), we are going to organize a similar event again in fall 2016.


## Topic of the Workshop

This year, the workshop is aimed at Galaxy administrators and will collocate with the Oktober meetup of the  [Galaxy-Admins discussion group](/Community/GalaxyAdmins). Similar to the regular Galaxy-Admins web-meetups, we intend to have a mixture of presentations about the use of the Galaxy framework and informations about the latest developments. We encourage presentations about your success stories using Galaxy as well as the problems you have encountered. Please indicate a preliminary title on the [registration page](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mRO4uNXQd8jL1I9JNiQ4xd0fnrZKlQPQSORgJCpDeqg).
