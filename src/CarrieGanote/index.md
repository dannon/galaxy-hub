# Recommendations for GCC2016 Participants

In addition to being on the GCC2016 Exec, Carrie also lives in Bloomington and has these recommendations for those of us that don't:

## Where to eat

Btown has a wide selection of dining options and prices. My recommendations are my own:

* Turkuaz - Turkish/Mediteranean food of good quality and medium price range. The veggie kabobs are my favorite but the lamb chops and pides are also great. Seats 15.
* Casa Brava - Near College Mall on the 9 or 3 bus. Seats 30. Great food that is reasonably priced. This is my favorite Mexican place.
* Uptown Cafe - Creole and Americana. Great atmosphere, medium price range. Seats 30. One of my favorite places.
* Tallent and Farm - upscale places. Farm is hit or miss. Tallent is usually great but very pricy.
* Delicious Thai Kitchen - far away from campus but delicious, especially good value for lunch.
* Chocolate Moose - Bloomington institution. Long lines but decent ice cream. It's a little hut in a parking lot.
* Siam House - service isn't the best, but decent Thai food.
* Little Tibet - good food, medium prices. A Bloomington institution.
* Jankos: Bloomington institution. I don't recommend this place - prices are outrageous. Steakhouse, Americana. Seats 20.

## Bars

* Nicks - Bloomington institution. Play Sink the Biz if you are brave. Great bar for hanging out and conversation, with nooks and crannies that aren't too loud. 
* Yogis - Cheap, food is ok. Great selection on draft.
* The Tap - Loud. Great selection on draft. Seats 20.
* Oliver Winery - I would recommend against. Go to the actual winery to try Oliver wines.
* Crazy Horse - Loud, fun, lots of options. Seats 25.
* Kilroys on Kirkwood and Kilroys Sports bar - loud, but can have good drink specials. Serve food. Seats 100.
* The Irish Lion - Decent Irish food and a good bar. Pub grub is reasonably priced and fancy items are also available. Seats 50.
