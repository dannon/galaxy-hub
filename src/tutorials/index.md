> :exclamation: *The Galaxy wiki is in the process of being reorganized and rewritten. This github-based site will serve as a temporary repository for our newest pages. The old wiki is [here](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/).*

## Table of contents
 * **Galaxy 101** - explains basics of Galaxy use. This tutorial takes you through downloading human genome annotation from UCSC Table Browser and manipulation of these data to count the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in exons of protein-coding genes. It end with the creation of a workflow and its use for the analysis of new data. This tutorial consists of two parts:
  - Part [1](Galaxy101-1)
  - Part [2](Galaxy101-2)
 * [**Introduction to NGS technologies**](Introduction-to-NGS-technologies) - a quick overview of next-generation sequencing technologies currently present on the market.
 * [**Processing many samples at once**](Processing-many-samples-at-once) - this tutorial expalins new feature of Galaxy interface - *dataset collections*. Dataset collections allow you to easily manipulate hundreads of samples in just a few clicks.
 * [**Diploid variant calling**](Diploid-variant-calling) - this tutorial demonstrates the use of Galaxy for finding seqeunce varinats in diploid genomes.
 * [**Reference-based RNAseq**](Reference-based-RNA-seq) - an in depth overview of reference-based RNAseq analysis including methodological details and hand-on explanation of differential gene expression analysis.
