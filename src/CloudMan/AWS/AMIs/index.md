# Page is intended to be included in other pages, not viewed directly.  Note that this page is partially included in places.  THEREFORE, ONLY CHANGE THE **Current AMI:** and **Deprecated AMIs** lines if you also update the places that include this.
**Current AMI:**
* AMI: ami-b45e59de
* Name: Galaxy-!CloudMan-1457720469 (active dates: 2016-03-24 -> present)

Note that the current AMI represents the environment required to run !CloudMan (in the format of a machine image) and *the machine image release date does not represent the most recent update or version of either !CloudMan or Galaxy*. Versions of those tools can be seen (and automatically updated, with the Update button in the !CloudMan Admin page) once an instance has been instantiated (we are also looking into a more explicit form of making this information available).
