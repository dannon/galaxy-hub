<div class='newsItemHeader'>[Baltimore Area Galaxy Meetup Jan 22](/News/BaltimoreMeetup201401)</div>

Hey Everyone,

<div class='right'><a href='/Events/Meetups/Baltimore/2015-01-22'><img src='/Events/Meetups/Baltimore/GalaxyBaltimoreMeetupLogo400.png' alt='Galaxy Baltimore Meetups' width="170" /></a></div>

We are looking forward to kicking off our first Galaxy Project Meetup! We will [meet on January 22](/src/Events/Meetups/Baltimore/2015-01-22/index.md) at one of the Galaxy project hubs - the Department of Biology of Johns Hopkins University for a general introduction to Galaxy in the form of a social gathering. This will be an informal meeting open to anyone interested in data analysis, tools, computer infrastructure, programming, ...

We will be kicking things off with a discussion on Galaxy and how researchers around the world are leveraging it.  See the [meetup page](/src/Events/Meetups/Baltimore/2015-01-22/index.md) for more information.

Please [RSVP](http://bit.ly/1Bz3Nrk) as space is limited.

We are hoping this will be the first of many meetups, both in the Baltimore area, and elsewhere.  If you are interested in hosting a meetup in your area, please contact [outreach@galaxyproject.org](Galaxy Outreach) and we will help you get the word out.

Thanks,

[Enis Afgan](/EnisAfgan) and [Nitesh Turaga](/NiteshTuraga), of the [Galaxy Team](/src/GalaxyTeam/index.md)
