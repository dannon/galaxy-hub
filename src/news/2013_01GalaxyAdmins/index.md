We use the [Blackboard Collaborate Web Conferencing system](../../Community/GalaxyAdmins/Meetups/WebinarTech) for the meetup. Downloading the required applets in advance and using a headphone with microphone to prevent audio feedback during the call is recommended.

[GalaxyAdmins](../../Community/GalaxyAdmins) is a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for large Galaxy installations.
