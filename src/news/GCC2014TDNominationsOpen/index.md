Training Day topics are [nominated by you](http://bit.ly/gcc2014tdnom), the Galaxy Community.  Please take a minute to nominate a topic.  Any topic of interest to the Galaxy Community can be nominated and you are encouraged to nominate more than one topic. If you are looking for ideas, see 
* [what was offered at GCC2013](../../Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay),  
* [what topics were nominated in 2013](http://bit.ly/1i2j1gN), and
* the [/Events](/Events) and the [Events Archive](../../Events/Archive) pages.

Nominated topics will be published on the [Training Day](../../Events/GCC2014/TrainingDay) page as they come in.  **Nominations close December 20**.  Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCC2014 Organizing Committee, and topics will be voted on by the Galaxy Community January 6-17.

Topics will then be selected and scheduled based on topic interest, and the organizers' ability to confirm instructors for each session.  Some very popular sessions may be scheduled more than once. The final schedule will be posted before registration opens.
