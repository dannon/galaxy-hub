<div class='newsItemHeader'>[GCC2013 Registration Ends 14 June](../../News/GCC2013Registration)</div>

[Register](/Events/GCC2013/Register) for [GCC2013](/Events/GCC2013) by 14 June and avoid the *100%* late surcharges.  Registration is still a bargain with combined registration ([Training Day](../../Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay) + [main meeting](/Events/GCC2013/Program)) starting at ~ €165 for post-docs and students (that just €55 per day). **[Register now](/Events/GCC2013/Register)** to assure your spot in the [Training Day workshops](../../Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay) you want to attend.  Once a Training Day session becomes full, it will be closed to new registrations.

[GCC2013](/Events/GCC2013) is an opportunity to participate in two full days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, keynotes, and lightning talks, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it. The conference also includes a [Training Day](../../Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay) with in-depth topic coverage of twelve different topics in 15 sessions across 5 tracks.

The [program](/Events/GCC2013/Program) features 25 oral presentations, 2 lightning talk sessions, two poster sessions, and an ever growing number of [Birds-of-a-Feather](../../Events/GCC2013/BoF) gatherings.

If you are a biologist or bioinformatician performing or enabling high-throughput biological research, then this conference is for you.
