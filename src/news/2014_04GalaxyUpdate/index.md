Happy April everyone!

First, there were a [record 63 new papers](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04.md#new-papers) in the past month, [six of which we have highlighted](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04.md#new-papers) (also a record).  Three new [public Galaxy servers](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04.md#new-public-servers), and one [Galaxy Community Log Board entry](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04.md#galaxy-community-hubs) were also added in March.
