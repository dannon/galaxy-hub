<div class='newsItemHeader'>[Galaxy-UK Community Launched](../../News/GalaxyUKLaunched)</div>

Dear UK Galaxy-devs,

We're delighted to announce the launch of the UK Galaxy Community.

Please visit [the site](http://galaxy-community.org.uk/) and have a look around:

  http://galaxy-community.org.uk/

The aims of Galaxy-UK are:

* To bring the Galaxy community in the United Kingdom closer together
* Identify and address the needs of the community
* Encourage interaction and collaboration.

Galaxy-UK is also an information hub for events such as:
* [UK based Galaxy training courses](http://galaxy-community.org.uk/category/galaxy-timeline/training/)
* [UK based talks involving Galaxy](http://galaxy-community.org.uk/news/)
* Information on the [location of UK Galaxy servers](http://galaxy-community.org.uk/galaxy-servers/)
* Anything else that might be pertinent to bring the UK Galaxy users/admins together as a community

We will be organising both online meetings and physical meetings, so keep an eye on the site for these events. 

Best wishes,

The Galaxy-UK Team
