The Galaxy Project will be applying for [Google Summer of Code 2014](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) as part of the [Genome Informatics Group](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC).  We are looking for project proposals to include in the group's submission to Google.  Please submit your proposals by January 31.  

If you are interested in submitting an idea, or being a mentor then please email [robin DOT haw AT oicr DOT on DOT ca](Robin Haw) *and* [outreach AT galaxyproject DOT org](outreach AT galaxyproject DOT org).  There is also a 
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/genome-informatics) and an IRC channel: #genomeinformatics on Freenode.

The Genome Informatics Group is organizing the joint efforts of Galaxy, [http://gmod.org/wiki/|GMOD](http://gmod.org/wiki/|GMOD), [Reactome](http://reactome.org), [SeqWare](http://seqware.github.com/), and [Wormbase](http://wormbase.org). This is a great opportunity for students to contribute to the work of any of these established bioinformatics projects.

If your interests lean more towards toolkits, I would like to point out that the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](http://open-bio.org), the group behind the *Bio** toolkits (including [BioPython](http://biopython.org/)) and the [BOSC](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2014) conferences, is also [looking for people to coordinate their proposal](http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/open-bio-l/2014-January/000922.html).
