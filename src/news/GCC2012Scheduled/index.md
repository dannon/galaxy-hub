**We are pleased to announce that the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](../../Events/GCC2012) has been scheduled for July 25-27 in Chicago, Illinois, United States.**  

GCC2012 will be held at the [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](http://uic.edu/) campus in downtown Chicago.  See the [GCC2012 conference web page](/Events/GCC2012) for more, including [opportunities to sponsor](../../Events/GCC2012/Sponsorships) this year's conference.

Some things will be the same as in previous years, but we are also using feedback from last year to guide the 2012 meeting.  We will again be seeking talks (full and lightning) from the community.  More information will be posted as it becomes available.

Please reserve July 25-27 on your calendars!

[Dave Clements](/DaveClements) and [Neil Bahroos](/NeilBahroos)
