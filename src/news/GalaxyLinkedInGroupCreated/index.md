A [Galaxy Group now exists on LinkedIn](http://bit.ly/gxyLinkedIn).  The group is open to anyone and is a forum to post [announcements, discussions](http://bit.ly/gxyLinkedIn), and [jobs of interest](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?jobs=&gid=4907635&trk=anet_ug_jobs) to the Galaxy community.

*Note that this **is not** an official support forum for the Galaxy Project.  Please continue to use the [mailing lists](../../MailingLists) for that purpose.*

If you are on !LinkedIn, please consider [joining the group](http://bit.ly/gxyLinkedIn) today.
