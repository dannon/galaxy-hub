We are pleased to announce the *[Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/Teach/GTN)*, a network of trainers who teach bioinformatics using Galaxy, or teach about Galaxy itself.  The GTN aims to make it easy to find [Galaxy trainers](/Teach/Trainers), and to share and discover the wealth of training resources available for Galaxy.  This includes [training materials](/Teach/Resources), a [trainer directory](/Teach/Trainers),[best practices](/Teach/BestPractices), and [guidance on computing platforms](/src/Teach/ComputingPlatforms/index.md) for teaching with Galaxy.  The Galaxy Training Network is accessible to the entire community.  

If you teach with Galaxy, then please consider adding [your organization](/Teach/Trainers#add-a-trainer), [materials](/Teach/Resources#add-a-training-resource), and [best practices](/Teach/BestPractices). The [Trainer Directory](/Teach/Trainers) already includes 16 organizations and there [may be one (or 6!) near you](http://bit.ly/gxytrnmap).

Thanks,

The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/Teach/Trainers/index.md)
