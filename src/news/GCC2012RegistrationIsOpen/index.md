[Registration](/Events/GCC2012/Register) is now open for the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](/Events/GCC2012).  This annual event will be held [July 25-27](/Events/GCC2012/Program) in [Chicago, Illinois](/Events/GCC2012/Logistics). The 2012 conference features [two full days](/Events/GCC2012/Program) of presentations, breakouts, and lightning talks about extending, developing, deploying, and best practices for Galaxy.  A [day long training event](/src/Events/GCC2012/TrainingDay/index.md) has also been added, covering 7 different topics in multiple tracks.
