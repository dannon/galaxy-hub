The Galaxy community now has a [mailing list dedicated to proteomics](http://proteomics.list.galaxyproject.org/).  If you're using Galaxy to do proteomics, or if you are thinking of doing so then this list if for you.  In case you missed it, there is also a [proteomics wiki page](../../Proteomics). 

To subscribe to the galaxy-proteomics list please add your email address to the list here:

See [the complete list of mailing lists](../../MailingLists) for more information on this and other Galaxy mailing lists, including links to searchable archives of all Galaxy lists.

Many thanks to Dave C. and the [Galaxy team](../../GalaxyTeam) for setting this up.

Thanks

Ira Cooke
