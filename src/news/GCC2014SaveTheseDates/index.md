The [2014 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2014)](/Events/GCC2014) will be held June 30 through July 2, at the [Homewood Campus](http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/campuses/homewood_campus/) of [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu), in [Baltimore, Maryland](http://visitors.baltimorecity.gov/), United States.

Galaxy Community Conferences are an opportunity to participate in presentations, discussions, poster sessions, lightning talks and breakouts, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it.  The conference will also includes a *Training Day* offering in-depth topic coverage, across several concurrent sessions.  See [the GCC2013 web site](../../Events/GCC2013) for an idea of what happens at a Galaxy Community Conference.
