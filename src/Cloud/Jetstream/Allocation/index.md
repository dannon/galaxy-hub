For the time being, it is necessary for each Jetstream user to request a new resource allocation or be added to someone's allocation. This page covers the process of getting an XSEDE *Startup* type of allocation. You will need an XSEDE account before you can proceed (visit https://www.xsede.org/ to create one).

* Start your allocation process by visiting http://jetstream-cloud.org/allocations.php and clicking on *Submit and manage allocation requests* link. After you logged in using your XSEDE account, choose *Startup* type of allocation.

* Next, set your role as a PI and click Next.

* In the next step, you will need to provide a title for your allocation and an abstract about your research. 100 words is sufficient. 
* Choose *Jetstream* as your desired target resource type and supply your anticipated usage for the duration of the project in [Service Units (SUs)](https://portal.xsede.org/knowledge-base/-/kb/document/bazo); projects are awarded on an annual basis so be careful not to forget about your instance left running when not in use. Note that 1 virtual CPU on an Jetstream instance corresponds to 1 SU. So, if you launch a 8 CPU instance, you will be using 8 SUs per each hour the instance is running. So, do some math and try to estimate how many SUs will you need each month.

* You will also ned to supply your CV. For *Startup* type allocation, adding supporting grants and publications is optional but feel free to add any.
