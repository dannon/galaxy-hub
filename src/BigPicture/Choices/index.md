Galaxy is available in several different ways.

## Main (UseGalaxy.org)

Galaxy has a free public server at [UseGalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org/) (also known as *Main*) that can be used by anyone.  See [Main](/src/Main/index.md) for more on this option.

## Install Galaxy Locally

You can also install your own local instance of Galaxy.  See [Get Galaxy](/src/Admin/GetGalaxy/index.md) for details on how to do this.

Alternatively, you can run a full-fledged Galaxy installation provided using a [Docker Image](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable).

## Use Galaxy on the Cloud

Another option is to install Galaxy on the *[Cloud](/src/Cloud/index.md)*.  The cloud is a virtual computational infrastructure provided by vendors that can be rented and scaled as needed. The Galaxy Project also developed and supports CloudMan, a software package that provides a common interface to different cloud infrastructures.

## Use Another Public Galaxy Server

Many [other Galaxy servers](/src/PublicGalaxyServers/index.md) besides [Main](/src/Main/index.md) have been made publicly available by other organizations.  One of these may meet your needs.  See [Public Galaxy Servers](/src/PublicGalaxyServers/index.md) for a list.

## Get the SlipStream Galaxy Appliance

Get a dedicated server pre-configured with a fully operational Galaxy instance.  SlipStream Galaxy minimizes the IT burden of running and maintaining your own local instance with pre-installed analysis tools, pre-loaded datasets, automatic software updates, and a high-performance infrastructure designed to handle computationally intensive analysis tasks.  Visit the [SlipStream Appliance: Galaxy Edition website](http://www.bioteam.net/slipstream/galaxy-edition) for pricing and other details.
