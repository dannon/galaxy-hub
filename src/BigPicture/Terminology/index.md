New to Galaxy?  Trying to figure out the difference between a *workflow* and a *history?*  This page attempts to be a glossary of Galaxy terminology.

### Dataset

*Datasets* are the inputs and outputs of each step in an analysis project in Galaxy. Datasets are associated with at least one [History](/src/BigPicture/Terminology/index.md#history), which can be labeled, manipulated, and shared with anyone, whether they have a Galaxy account or not. The tracking information associated with Datasets in a History represent an experimental record of the methods, parameters, and other inputs. These methods are easily extracted into Workflows, making an analysis pathway transparent, reproducible, and reusable.

Effectively managing datasets is important for general organization, collaboration, and publishing and for staying within the quotas set by the [Main](/src/BigPicture/Terminology/index.md#main), [Test](/src/BigPicture/Terminology/index.md#test), and other host instances.

* [Learn/Managing Datasets](/src/Learn/ManagingDatasets/index.md)

### Galaxy Objects

### History

### Job runner

A computer process responsible for starting and monitoring jobs, submitting jobs to a cluster (if configured), and for setting metadata (externally or internally).

See 
* [Admin/Config/Performance/Scaling](/src/Admin/Config/Performance/Scaling/index.md)

### Main

*Main* is the free public Galaxy instance available at [UseGalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org/) (or http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu). This is the primary [Galaxy instance](http://usegalaxy.org/). Main is where Galaxy's data and tools are functionality integrated and ready to use. Main is useful for sharing/publishing data and methods with colleagues for routine analysis or with the larger scientific community for publications and supplemental material. *[Test](/src/Test/index.md)* is also free and public, but is considered a beta site.
