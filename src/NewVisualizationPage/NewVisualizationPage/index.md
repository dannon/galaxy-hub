Trackster is Galaxy's built-in genome browser and is similar to IGV, IGB, and Ensembl's & UCSC's genome browsers. Trackster highlights includes:

* visualize SAM/BAM, !BedGraph, Wiggle/BigWig, BED/BigBED, GFF/GFF3/GTF, and VCF datasets;
* will work with very large datasets;
* no data or software downloads;
* save, share, and publish your visualizations.
