Working for the [Galaxy team](/src/GalaxyTeam/index.md) provides a rare opportunity to perform research and develop software at the leading edge of life sciences, genomics, data-intensive computing, and big data analytics.

We develop [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org), a free, open-source platform that (a) enables researchers to store, analyze, visualize and share genomic data and (b) provides genomic tool developers with the ability to deploy their tools within a complete analysis framework.  Galaxy is well known with [thousands of researchers worldwide](/GalaxyProject/Statistics) using it on a daily basis. Our [team members](/src/GalaxyTeam/index.md) are well regarded and widely recognized within the vast biomedical domain.  With genomics being the pivot of future life sciences and healthcare, joining the Galaxy project will open an immense array of possibilities.

Positions are available at:
* [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.johnshopkins.edu/), Baltimore, MD (in the [lab of PI James Taylor](http://taylorlab.org/)) 
* [Penn State University](http://psu.edu/), State College, PA (in the lab of [PI Anton Nekrutenko](http://bmb.psu.edu/directory/aun1))
* [George Washington University](http://gwu.edu/), Washington, D.C. (in the lab of [PI Jeremy Goecks](http://jeremygoecks.com))
 
Interested?  We'd love to hear from you.  Please send your CV, a cover letter, and the names/e-mail addresses of three references to [gxyhiring AT galaxyproject DOT org](gxyhiring AT galaxyproject DOT org).  The Galaxy Project is committed to recruiting, supporting and fostering a diverse community. Johns Hopkins University, Penn State University and George Washington University are Equal Opportunity employers.

## Software Engineers

We have a wide variety of active projects, current areas of expertise sought include:

* **Web-based visualization and visual analytics.** We are building novel interactive visualizations of large genomic datasets that leverage cutting edge Web technologies.
* **Informatics and data analysis and integration.**  We build and use tools to analyze large datasets generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing to understand genomes and genome function.
* **Distributed computing and systems programming.** We are engaged in the development of workflow systems, cloud computing based solutions, and other projects involving high performance and data intensive computing.
* **Bioinformatics application areas** such as re-sequencing, *de novo* assembly, metagenomics, transcriptome analysis and epigenetics.

Regardless of your areas of expertise we seek talented, self-motivated individuals to join [our team](/src/GalaxyTeam/index.md). Galaxy is developed in an academic research environment, and members of the Galaxy team work closely with biomedical researchers on projects at the leading edge of data-intensive biology.

Galaxy is written in Python, but also makes substantial use of !JavaScript, Canvas, and other modern Web technologies. Many of the analysis components of Galaxy are performance critical and are implemented in C and other languages as well.

## Postdoctoral Scholars

We are recruiting postdoctoral scholars with expertise in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Our work on Galaxy is driven by our biological and biomedical research programs, and we are interested in hearing from potential postdocs with a wide variety of research interests:

* **Computational, Visualization, and HCI research** on both the development of scientific analysis and data management tools, and the creation of novel user interfaces and interactive visualizations for analyzing large-scale biomedical data.
* **Distributed and high-performance computing** for data intensive science, specifically genomics.
* **Vertebrate functional and evolutionary genomics**, particularly through the development of novel machine learning, data mining, and data integration methods incorporating genomic sequence and experimental data.
* **Cancer genomics**, with a focus on developing tools and pipelines for integrative data analysis to enable personalized medicine.
* And **numerous areas of biology** including genomic and epigenomic mechanisms of gene regulation, the role of transcription factors and chromatin structure in global gene expression, development, and differentiation.
