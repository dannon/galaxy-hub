# span

The span macro was downloaded from the [MoinMoin MacroMarket](http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket).  This page was copied and modified from the [span macro homepage](http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/span).

## Description
You can use this macro to open and close (html) spans

For the content contained in the span you can:
* apply a css class (`css_class` param sets `class` attr)
* give it a id (`id` param/attr)
* set its language (`lang` param/attr)
* set its writing direction (`dir` param/attr)

By definition, a span works only within ONE block, so if you need something for multiple blocks (e.g. multiple paragraphs), you have to open/close it in each block.  See the [div macro](/HelpOnMacros/div) for spanning multiple blocks.

For details about the span html element, see the [span specification on w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.4).
