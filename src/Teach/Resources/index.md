There are many resources available that are helpful for teaching Galaxy.  This page attempts to summarize them in one location.  This page links to workshop materials for different topics.  That material can be in this wiki, inside Galaxy instances, or anywhere on the web.

# Add a Training Resource

Have you created or know of a resource that is useful for teaching with Galaxy?  Then please share it!  This will help others and also help get the word out about your resource.

**Use the Wiki**

To add a training resource to this directory, create a wiki page describing the resource. Here are the directions:

1. [Login|&action=login](/Community/Deployments) to the wiki. If you don't have an account, you'll need to [create one|&action=newaccount](/Community/Deployments).
1. Pick a good descriptive, !CamelCase name for your deployment.  This will become part of the URL for the page describing your deployment.  Avoid embedded spaces as they make lousy URLs.
1. Type the !CamelCase name in box below and hit the "Create" button.
    . <<NewPage(Teach/Resources/ResourceTemplate, "Create a teaching resource description page", Teach/Resource)>>
1. A template for the new page will appear.  Replace the template text with details about the resource.
1. Save, review, and edit the page until you are happy with it.
1. Return to this page, and review how the resource appears in this listing.

**Use a Google Form**

If the wiki option seems a little daunting, you can also describe this resource in a [Google Form](http://bit.ly/gxytrainresourceform).  Once the form has been submitted, the information will be reviewed and an training resource page will be created within a week or two.  You will be notified via email when the page is created.
