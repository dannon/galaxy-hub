The *Galaxy Trainer Directory* is a service of the [Galaxy Training Network](/Teach/GTN) which aims to make it easy to share and find [Galaxy training resources](../Resources).  This directory lists individuals and groups that do Galaxy training.  The contacts listed here are willing to present Galaxy at meetings and workshops.  The directory includes particular areas of expertise and how far the instructors are willing to travel.

If you offer Galaxy Training and want to be listed in this directory then see the **[Add a Trainer](#add-a-trainer)** section below.

<br />

# Trainers

* **[Global](#global):** around the world
* **[Continental](#continental):** across their continent 
* **[Regional](#regional):** Willing to travel beyond their local area, but not across their continent
* **[Local](#local):** These trainers don't travel, but their workshops are open to researchers outside their institution.

* *Description:*
    [EMBL Australian Bioinformatics Resource](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/) is a distributed national research infrastructure providing bioinformatics support to life science researchers in Australia. EMBL ABR aims to provide new opportunities and harmonise existing training efforts across Australia to maximise the reach and scope of bioinformatics training, as well as to share experience and best practice from Australia with international initiatives. The [EMBL ABR Training programme](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/training/) comprises a series of focal topics to tackle training gaps with the aim of enabling sustainable and scalable bioinformatics use by life scientists across Australia. There are three main factors contributing to training gaps among life science researchers: 
    1. insufficient exposure to the principles and application of bioinformatics; 
    1. the speed at which technologies, data analysis practices and tools develop and the lag in how these are incorporated into the current undergraduate and postgraduate curricula 
    1. a lack of support within some research groups or institutions for students and postdoctoral researchers to learn bioinformatics skills and tools. 

* *Domains:*
  * Currently, in terms of topics we offer training on: 
    * Introduction to Galaxy 
    * Galaxy Workflows

In the fall of 2007, bioinformatics.ca moved to its new host at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and the CBW initiated development of a new format and series of exciting workshops. It was recognized that with the introduction of new technologies and scientific approaches to research, having the computational biology capacity and skill to deal with this new data has become an even greater asset. This new series of workshops focuses on training the researchers of these advanced technologies on the latest approaches being used in computational biology to deal with the new data. In one of the workshops we teach, [Informatics on High Throughput Sequencing Data](http://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2013/informatics-high-throughput-sequencing-data), we teach 1/2 day on use of Galaxy in NGS analysis. We cover an overview of Galaxy as well as an example of RNA-Seq and SNP-calling (lab).

# Add a Trainer

Do you or your organization do Galaxy training?  Then please tell the Galaxy Community!  You can either edit this wiki page directly (you will need to create a login), or **submit the information through [this online form.](http://bit.ly/gxytrainerform)**

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Have instructors in this directory been vetted in any way?**

No, not in any rigorous or official way.  However, trainers listed here are well-known in their communities.
<br /><br />

**Q: What does it cost to bring a trainer to my institution or event?**

That depends entirely on who does the training.  Most/All of these groups are **not** specifically funded to do Galaxy Training outside their home organization.  It may require creative funding and/or a nearby trainer to get Galaxy Training at your institution or event.  The trainer location map can help you identify nearby trainers.

**Q: Where can I find other non-Galaxy specific bioinformatics training?**

<div class='right'><a href='http://mygoblet.org'><img src='/Images/Logos/GobletLogo.png' alt='Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education & Training (GOBLET)' height="140" /></a></div>

Most of the members of the GTN also do bioinformatics training that isn't Galaxy-based.  If you want training that involves both Galaxy-based and non-Galaxy-based material than the GTN membership is the best place to start.  For general bioinformatics training a great place to look for trainers is the [Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education & Training (GOBLET)](http://mygoblet.org). GOBLET was founded in 2012 by a group of international & national societies & networks to offer an umbrella for bioinformatics, biocuration, biocomputing & computational biology learning, education & training. It has online resource directories, very similar to what the GTN has.

And, as of 2015 the [Galaxy Training Network](/Teach/GTN) is a proud member of [GOBLET](http://mygoblet.org).
