The *[Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/Teach/GTN)* is a network of people and groups that present Galaxy and Galaxy-based training around the world.  GTN helps researchers find online training material, and trainers in their geographic area, and helps advertise [training events](/src/Events/index.md) as well.

These pages describes the Galaxy Training Network, and everything else related to teaching Galaxy or teaching Bioinformatics with Galaxy:

## Training Resources Directory

The **[Training Resources Directory](/src/Teach/Resources/index.md)** is a catalog of training resources for Galaxy.  *Training resources* include tutorials, slides, virtual machines, and entire workshop packages that can be used to teach with Galaxy.

There is also an [easy way to add new resources](/Teach/Resources#add-a-training-resource) to the directory.
