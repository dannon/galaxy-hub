This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/), a [public Galaxy server](/src/PublicGalaxyServers/index.md) specifically for learning bioinformatics analysis.

In this tutorial we cover the concepts of RNA-Seq differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using a very small synthetic dataset from a well studied organism.


## Needed Tools

This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/).  All needed tools are on the server.


## Datasets

"The data for this tutorial is from an RNA-seq experiment looking for differentially expressed genes in *D. melanogaster* (fruit fly) between two experimental conditions."

Needed datasets exist in Shared Libraries on the server, and are also available via URL.
