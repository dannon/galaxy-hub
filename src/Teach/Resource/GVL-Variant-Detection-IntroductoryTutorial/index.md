[This tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ZRzrjjOCvtAu3m-IKL-rbJ1f4On60dDL_IEwG7oejdI) runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/), a [public Galaxy server](../../../PublicGalaxyServers) specifically for learning bioinformatics analysis.

In this tutorial we cover the concepts of detecting small variants (SNVs and indels) in human genomic DNA using a small set of reads from chromosome 22.

## Needed Tools

This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/).  All needed tools are on the server.

## Datasets

The workshop is based on analysis of short read data from the exome of chromosome 22 of a single human individual. There are one million 76bp reads in the dataset, produced on an Illumina GAIIx from exome-enriched DNA. This data was generated as part of the 1000 Genomes project: http://www.1000genomes.org/

Needed datasets exist in Shared Libraries on the server, and are also available via URL.
