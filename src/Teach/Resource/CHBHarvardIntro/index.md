This is [one of a set of online tutorials](http://hbc.github.io/ngs-workshops/courses/) created (and maintained!) by Shannan Ho Sui, Oliver Hofmann, and Winston Hide in the [Center for Health Bioinformatics](http://compbio.sph.harvard.edu/chb/) at the [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/).

This is an introduction to Galaxy's functionality.  It uses text manipulation, filtering, get flanking regions, the UCSC Table Browser, and genomic interval operations, which exist on most Galaxy servers.  It also covers sharing and publishing of results.
