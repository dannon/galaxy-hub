Clicking on the **Search for valid tools** menu item will display the following page. You can search repositories for valid tools by entering any combination of tool id, name and version. You can also specify if you want to restrict searches to exact matches. Here we are searching for all valid tools whose id contains the letter **b** and whose version contains the string **1.0.0** (we are not matching on the exact strings).

Clicking the **Search repositories** button will display a list of all tool shed repositories that matched our criteria (i.e., the repository contains at least 1 tool whose id contains the letter **b** and whose version contains the string **1.0.0**). Clicking on the repository name link will display the information for that repository and associated change set revision.
