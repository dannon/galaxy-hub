The [main Galaxy server](/src/Main/index.md) does not currently (2011/07) provide support for microarray data.  This page describes other options.

## Public Galaxy Servers

There are numerous other [/Public Galaxy Servers](/Public Galaxy Servers).  These are known to provide some support for microarrays:

| Server |  Purpose / Community  |  Other Comments  |  Restrictions  |  Sponsor  | 
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------- | 
| [CHARM](http://charm.jhmi.edu/p/) |  McrBC/CHARM DNA methylation microarray data analysis  |  "CHARM refers to a custom DNA methylation tiling array design and a normalization pipeline. This web application is a front end to the CHARM analysis tools which currently support data generated using the restriction enzyme McrBC. It allows you to analyse DNA methylation microarray data using a web browser without installing additional software. For users who are comfortable with R a Bioconductor package is also available."  |   |  [Johns Hopkins Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/)  |
