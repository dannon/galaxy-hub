Permissions notes:
* Everybody (including anonymous users) sees libraries that are public.
* If you are logged in you also see the ones that your user has access to.
* Only people with proper permissions see the controls to modify the library and change its permissions.
* Only [administrators](../../../Admin) see deleted libraries and can create new ones.
