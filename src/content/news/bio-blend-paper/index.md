A new paper, "[BioBlend: automating pipeline analyses within Galaxy and CloudMan](http://bit.ly/11AuV4O)," by Clare Sloggett, Nuwan Goonasekera and [Enis Afgan](/src/people/enis-afgan/index.md) has just been published in *[Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/)*. BioBlend is 

<div class='indent'>
a unified API in a high-level language (python) that wraps the functionality of Galaxy and CloudMan APIs. BioBlend makes it easy for bioinformaticians to automate end-to-end large-data analysis, from scratch, in a way that is highly accessible to collaborators, by allowing them to both provision the required infrastructure, and automate complex analyses over large data sets within the familiar Galaxy environment.
