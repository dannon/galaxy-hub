The [MDC Berlin-Buch](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/) is a member of the [Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers](http://www.helmholtz.de/), and its focus is biomedical research in the areas of Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases, Cancer and Function and Dysfunction of Nervous System. The [Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (BIMSB)](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/40549075/de/bimsb) expands and adds systems biology approaches to major questions of gene regulatory function.

As a bioinformatics scientist/engineer you will be a member of the Scientific Bioinformatics Platform @BIMSB and report to the head of the platform, Dr. Altuna Akalin. You will be responsible for method and database development for genomics data sets relating to RNA biology and projects of the [German Network of Bioinformatics (de.NBI)](https://www.systembiologie.de/de/foerderung/national/nbi). You will be interacting and collaborating with BIMSB research groups as well as national collaboration partners.  **The projects will be using Galaxy framework for tool development and data integration.**

Applicants should have PhD degree or equivalent practical experience in research oriented software development in one of the following fields: computational genomics, bioinformatics, computer science, statistics or another quantitative field. We are looking for talented team members with a proven track record in software development and interest in genomics and large-scale datasets. Experience and/or interest in database technologies (SQL and/or noSQL), web technologies (HTML, XML, REST API, etc.) and traditional high-performance computing clusters is also necessary.
