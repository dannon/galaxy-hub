The **Galaxy Public [Main Galaxy Server](/src/main/index.md)** at **http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu''' (''[usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org)*) and **[Test Galaxy Server](/src/test/index.md)** at **http://test.g2.bx.psu.edu''' will be '''down on Thursday, March 14, while the team ''relocates core hardware to a new server room.'''''

<div class='right'>![Rerun a job](/src/images/screenshots/re-run-sm.png)</div>

Please note that *ALL jobs running at the time of the shutdown will be terminated.* Once the move is complete, any terminated jobs can be easily restarted using the "re-run" function. 

The *yellow banner on **Main** and **Test** will provide updates* (when the servers are up) as well our **galaxyproject Twitter posts**.

**Galaxy's [Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/), [Galaxy Hub](/src/index.md), and [Mailing list](/src/mailing-lists/index.md) services** will be ***unaffected*** during this time. 

*Thanks for using Galaxy!!*

[Galaxy Team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md)
