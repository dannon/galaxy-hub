[Plant and Animal Genome XX (PAG2012)](/src/events/pag2012/index.md) starts in San Diego on January 14.  If you are attending PAG then you will have (at least) [a half-dozen opportunities](/src/events/pag2012/index.md) to learn more about Galaxy and how it is being used to support research.  There will be workshops introducing Galaxy, and on deploying Galaxy in the cloud, and talks and posters on using Galaxy and several local Galaxy deployments.  See the [Galaxy @ PAG2012 page](/src/events/pag2012/index.md) and the [conference website](http://www.intlpag.org/) for more information.

Dannon Baker and [Dave Clements](/src/people/dave-clements/index.md) from the [Galaxy Team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) will also be there throughout the meeting.  Please feel free to ask us questions, or just introduce yourself.

Hope to see you in San Diego,

[Dave Clements](/src/people/dave-clements/index.md) and Dannon Baker<br />
[Galaxy Team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md)
