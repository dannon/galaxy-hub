**We are pleased to announce that [early registration](/src/events/gcc2013/register/index.md) and [paper and poster abstract submission](/src/events/gcc2013/abstracts/index.md) are now open for the [2013 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2013)](/src/events/gcc2013/index.md).**  GCC2013 will be held 30 June through July 2 in Oslo Norway, at the [University of Oslo](http://uio.no).

[GCC2013](/src/events/gcc2013/index.md) is an opportunity to participate in two full days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, keynotes, lightning talks and breakouts, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it. The conference also includes a [Training Day](/src/events/gcc2013/training-day/index.md) for the second year in a row, this year with more in-depth topic coverage, more concurrent sessions, and more topics.

If you are a biologist or bioinformatician performing or enabling high-throughput biological research, then please consider attending.  GCC2013 is aimed at:

* Bioinformatics tool developers and data providers
* Workflow developers and power bioinformatics users
* Sequencing and Bioinformatics core staff
* Data archival and analysis reproducibility specialists

**[Early registration](/src/events/gcc2013/register/index.md)** is now open. Register early and *save up to 75% off regular registration costs.*  Early registration is very affordable, with combined registration ([Training Day](/src/events/gcc2013/training-day/index.md) + main meeting) starting at ~ â‚¬95 for post-docs and students.  Registering early also assures you a spot in the Training Day workshops you want to attend.  Once a session becomes full, it will be closed to new registrations.  Early registration closes 24 May. 

**[Abstract submission](/src/events/gcc2013/abstracts/index.md)** for both oral presentations and posters is also open.  Abstract submission for oral presentations closes 12 April, and poster abstract submission closes 3 May.  Please consider presenting your work. If you are dealing with big biological data, then this meeting wants to hear about your work.

Thanks, and hope to see you in Oslo!
