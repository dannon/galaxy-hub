Three events were sponsored by the [Galaxy User Group Grand Ouest (GUGGO)](https://www.e-biogenouest.org/groups/guggo) in western France earlier this fall.  Summaries of all 3 events are now available online.

The *[Tools integration on Galaxy Workshop](http://go4bioinformatics.genouest.org/integration-doutils-dans-la-plateforme-web-galaxy/)* was held 11 September.  The [summary](https://www.e-biogenouest.org/resources/1312/about) includes several of the talks (click on "Supporting Docs").  The *[Fourth GUGGO meeting](http://www.biogenouest.org/agenda/evenement/groupe-de-travail-des-utilisateurs-galaxy-du-grand-ouest-guggo)* followed on 15 September.  A [meeting summary](https://www.e-biogenouest.org/groups/guggo/wiki/GugGo4) and [report](https://www.e-biogenouest.org/resources/1336) are available.  Finally, the *[RADseq analysis using STACKS on Galaxy Workshop](http://go4bioinformatics.genouest.org/analyse-de-donnees-de-type-rad-par-le-pipeline-stacks-sous-la-plateforme-web-danalyse-de-donnees-galaxy/)* was held on 25 September.
