A new paper, "[A reference model for deploying applications in virtualized environments](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.1836/full)," by [Enis Afgan](/src/people/enis-afgan/index.md), [Dannon Baker](/src/people/dannon-baker/index.md) *et al.* has been published in *[Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%291532-0634)*.  The paper describes a "reference model for deploying applications into virtualized environments" that "is rooted in the low-level components common to a range of virtualized environments" describing "how to compose those otherwise dispersed components into a coherent unit."  The paper addresses the problem of "deploying applications so that they can take advantage of the elasticity of the environment and deliver it transparently to users" with the aim of enabling widespread adoption of virtualization.
