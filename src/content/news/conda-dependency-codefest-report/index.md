title: "Conda Dependencies Codefest Report"

The [codefest](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/issues/700) started via hangouts at 10am EDT on Monday April 4, with around 8 participants. It was designed to be beginner friendly, which increased contribution from the community. 4 members of the galaxy community were [added as contributors](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues/1#issuecomment-205241333) to the [bioconda-recipe repository](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) as a result of this hackathon.

The codefest started with [Björn Grüning](/src/people/bjoern-gruening/index.md) giving a small introduction to [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) and its channel [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/). Followed by how to create a new Conda recipe and the scripts involved in it. Members of the hack started by then picking up a simple tool and creating a Pull request against both the [Tools-IUC](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc) and [bioconda-recipes](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) repositories on GitHub.

The main aim of the codefest was to get community members familiar with the Conda-Galaxy integration, and to remove tools from testing blacklist (shown below).

More details are [here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/issues/700).
