We are pleased to announce the *[Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/teach/gtn/index.md)*, a network of trainers who teach bioinformatics using Galaxy, or teach about Galaxy itself.  The GTN aims to make it easy to find [Galaxy trainers](/src/teach/trainers/index.md), and to share and discover the wealth of training resources available for Galaxy.  This includes [training materials](/src/teach/resources/index.md), a [trainer directory](/src/teach/trainers/index.md),[best practices](/src/teach/best-practices/index.md), and [guidance on computing platforms](/src/teach/computing-platforms/index.md) for teaching with Galaxy.  The Galaxy Training Network is accessible to the entire community.  

If you teach with Galaxy, then please consider adding [your organization](/src/teach/trainers/index.md#add-a-trainer), [materials](/src/teach/resources/index.md#add-a-training-resource), and [best practices](/src/teach/best-practices/index.md). The [Trainer Directory](/src/teach/trainers/index.md) already includes 16 organizations and there [may be one (or 6!) near you](http://bit.ly/gxytrnmap).

Thanks,

The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/teach/trainers/index.md)
