Happy April everyone!  

It's a busy time [in the Galaxy](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md) and that is reflected in the [April 2014 Galaxy Update](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md).  First, there were a [record 63 new papers](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#new-papers) in the past month, [six of which we have highlighted](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#new-papers) (also a record).  Three new [public Galaxy servers](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#new-public-servers), and one [Galaxy Community Log Board entry](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#galaxy-community-hubs) were also added in March.

However, the big news this month is [Upcoming Events](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#events):

* **[Abstract submission for oral presentations](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#oral-presentation-abstract-submission-closes-april-4) for the [2014 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2014)](/src/galaxy-updates/2014-04/index.md#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore) closes this Friday, April 4.**
