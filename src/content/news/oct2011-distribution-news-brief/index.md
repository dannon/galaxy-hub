**Highlights:**

* User Interface updates and new features for managing data and more
* Trackster (aka Galaxy Track Browser or GTB) at `BioVis`, too many new features to list out, try it!
* It's official, Python 2.7 is the standard and 2.4 is deprecated 
* Smooth new Tool Shed functions make setting up a local Galaxy even easier (and it was pretty easy already)
* Source updates, bug fixes, new scripts, wrapped tools, and custom tools
