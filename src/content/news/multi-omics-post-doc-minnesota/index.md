A [post-doctoral position](http://z.umn.edu/galaxypostdoc2016) is available at the University of Minnesota for development of bioinformatics tools, with a focus on applications that integrate data across ‘omics’ domains (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics). A particular emphasis is in the integration of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data with other types of ‘omics’ data for applications in proteogenomics and metaproteomics. The researcher will join a successful team of developers, collaborators and users who have developed the Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) platform (see [usegalaxyp.org](http://usegalaxyp.org) and [references](http://z.umn.edu/galaxypreferences)). 

A Ph.D. in bioinformatics, computer science, analytical chemistry or closely related field is required. Experience with MS-based proteomics data analysis is highly preferred, and familiarity with the Galaxy framework is a plus. 

Interested applicants can apply directly to [Dr. Tim Griffin](mailto:tgriffin@umn.edu).
