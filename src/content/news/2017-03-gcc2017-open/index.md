We are pleased to announce that  [early registration](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/registration) and [abstract submission](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit) for the **[2017 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2017)](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/)** are now open.

GCC2017 will be in Montpellier, France, 26-30 June and will feature two days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, lightning talks, computer demos, keynotes, and birds-of-a-feather meetups, **all about data-intensive biology and the tools and infrastructure that support it.** GCC2017 also includes data and coding hacks, and **[two days of training](https://gcc2017.sched.com/overview/type/Training)** covering 16 different topics.
 
GCC2017 will be held at [Le Corum Conference Centre](http://www.montpellier-events.com/en/The-Corum/Presentation) in the heart of [Montpellier](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/location), just 10km from the Mediterranean. This event will gather several hundred researchers addressing diverse questions and facing common challenges in data intensive life science research. GCC participants work across the tree of life, come from around the world, and work at universities, research organizations, industry, medical schools and research hospitals.  

If you work in or support data intensive life science research then GCC2017 is an ideal opportunity to present your work.  **[Abstract submission](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit) is now open.**  The deadline for oral presentations is Apr 15 (23:59 Paris local time), and posters and computer demonstration submission closes on May 27 (23:59 Paris local time). The Lightning talk submission deadline is June 23 (23:59 Paris time). 

**[Early registration](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/registration)** is also open and starts at less than 55â‚¬ / day for post-docs and students.  You can also [book low cost conference housing](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/lodging) when you register. (Travel fellowships will be offered by the Galaxy Community Fund and will be announced shortly.)
