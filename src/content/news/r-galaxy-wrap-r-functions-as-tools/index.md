Normally, in order to expose an [R function](http://www.r-project.org/) as a tool in a Galaxy instance, you need to manually create an XML fi
le with information about the function, and modify an additional XML 
file.  The new [RGalaxy package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/html/RGalaxy.html) in [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) automates this process, pulling most of the necessary information from the R function itself and its manual page (you provide the remaining information as arguments to the Galaxy function).

[RGalaxy](http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/html/RGalaxy.html) itself comes with a [man page](http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/vignettes/RGalaxy/inst/doc/Rgalaxy-vignette.pdf), and a [reference manual](http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.11/bioc/manuals/RGalaxy/man/RGalaxy.pdf). 

Please note that the package is now available only in the development branch of Bioconductor. So to install it, you need to have R-2.15, and do the following:
```python
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
useDevel()
biocLite("RGalaxy")
```
