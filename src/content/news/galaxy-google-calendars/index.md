If you want to know what events are happening in the Galaxy Community, the goto place has always been the [Galaxy Events page](/src/events/index.md).  This lists any upcoming events we know about that feature Galaxy content.  This events list provides dates, locations, and contact information for each event.

<div class='right'><a href='http://bit.ly/gxycal'><img src="/src/images/icons/CalendarIcon.gif" alt="Galaxy Calendar" /></a></div>

There has also been the complementary *[Galaxy Events Google Calendar](http://bit.ly/gxycal)* which listed events of interest to the community, whether or not they featured significant Galaxy content.  **To make this calendar more useful, we have split it in to two:**

 **[Galaxy Events Google Calendar](http://bit.ly/gxycal)** <a href='http://bit.ly/gxycalrss'><img src="/src/images/icons/RSSIcon16x16.gif" alt="Galaxy Calendar RSS Feed" /></a>
   This calendar now lists *only* events that feature Galaxy content.  Pretty much, if it's on the [Events page](/src/events/index.md), it's also in this calendar.<br />

 **[Galaxy Other Events Google Calendar](http://bit.ly/gxyothercal)**  <a href='http://bit.ly/gxyothercalrss'><img src="/src/images/icons/RSSIcon16x16.gif" alt="Galaxy Calendar RSS Feed" /></a> 
   This lists additional events and deadlines that are relevant to the Galaxy Community, but that are not known to feature significant Galaxy content. 

This split allows us to present Galaxy events in a much sparser calendar, that is more useful for setting reminders and publishing Galaxy events.

And we will continue to link to past Galaxy events (and presentations, videos, examples, ...) from the  *[Events Archive](/src/events/index.md#past-events)*.
