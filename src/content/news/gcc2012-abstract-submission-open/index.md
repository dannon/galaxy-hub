[Abstracts](/src/events/gcc2012/abstracts/index.md) are now being accepted for oral presentations at the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](/src/events/gcc2012/index.md).  Submissions on any topics of interest to the Galaxy community are encouraged. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Best practices for local Galaxy installation and management
* Integrating tools and/or data sources into the Galaxy framework
* Deploying galaxy on different infrastructures
* Compelling or novel uses of Galaxy for biomedical analysis 

See the [GCC2011 program](/src/events/gcc2011/index.md) for an idea of the breadth of topics that are covered. Oral presentations will be approximately 15-20 minutes long, including time for question and answer. There will also be an opportunity for lightning talks, which will be solicited at the meeting.  The submission deadline is April 16.  See the [GCC2012 Abstracts](/src/events/gcc2012/abstracts/index.md) page for more details and how to submit.

[GCC2012](/src/events/gcc2012/index.md) will be held, July 25-27 in Chicago, Illinois, United States.  GCC2012 will run for [two full days](/src/events/gcc2012/program/index.md), and be preceded by a [full day of training workshops](/src/events/gcc2012/program/index.md).  If you are a bioinformatics tool developer, data provider, workflow developer, power bioinformatics user, sequencing or bioinformatics core staff, or a data and analysis archival specialist, then GCC2012 is for you.  Registration will open in March.
