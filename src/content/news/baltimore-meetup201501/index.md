Hey Everyone,

<div class='right'><a href='/src/events/meetups/baltimore/2015-01-22/index.md'><img src="/src/events/meetups/baltimore/GalaxyBaltimoreMeetupLogo400.png" alt="Galaxy Baltimore Meetups" width="170" /></a></div>

We are looking forward to kicking off our first Galaxy Project Meetup! We will [meet on January 22](/src/events/meetups/baltimore/2015-01-22/index.md) at one of the Galaxy project hubs - the Department of Biology of Johns Hopkins University for a general introduction to Galaxy in the form of a social gathering. This will be an informal meeting open to anyone interested in data analysis, tools, computer infrastructure, programming, ...

We will be kicking things off with a discussion on Galaxy and how researchers around the world are leveraging it.  See the [meetup page](/src/events/meetups/baltimore/2015-01-22/index.md) for more information.

Please [RSVP](http://bit.ly/1Bz3Nrk) as space is limited.

We are hoping this will be the first of many meetups, both in the Baltimore area, and elsewhere.  If you are interested in hosting a meetup in your area, please contact [Galaxy Outreach](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org) and we will help you get the word out.

Thanks,

[Enis Afgan](/src/people/enis-afgan/index.md) and [Nitesh Turaga](/src/people/nitesh-turaga/index.md), of the [Galaxy Team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md)
