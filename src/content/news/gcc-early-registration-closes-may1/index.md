[Galaxy Community Conference registration](http://galaxy.psu.edu/gcc2011/Register.html) is now open again. Early registration ends May 1.  We had limited success in finding additional lodging for on May 24 and May 26:

**May 24 Lodging:** As expected, we were not able to secure additional hotel rooms at the conference centre for May 24, the evening before the meeting.  We encourage people who need a room on May 24 to stay in Amsterdam that night, and then take the train to Lunteren the next morning.  There is ample time to arrive before the 9:30am start of the meeting on the 25th.  We regret the inconvenience that this will cause for people who will not be able to stay at the conference centre on May 24.

**May 25 and 26 Lodging:** We were able to reserve additional rooms for the night of May 26. We now have about 35 open hotel rooms reserved at the conference center on the nights of May 25 and May 26 (the night after the meeting).

However, we expect the rooms for May 25 to sell out, possibly in advance of the May 1 early registration deadline.  If you are planning on staying at the conference centre, we strongly recommend that you register as soon as possible.  Once those rooms are full, the whole centre will be full.

Thank you all for your patience while we worked on this.  I apologize for and regret any inconvenience this has caused.  As always, please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
