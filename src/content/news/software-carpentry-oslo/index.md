Directly following GCC2013, there is a unique possibility to attend a [two-day Software Carpentry Boot Camp at the University of Oslo](http://bit.ly/14EmcSA) (in a building close to where the GCC is held). [Software Carpentry Boot Camps](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/) aim to to help scientists and engineers become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version control, testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot camp, short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises.

The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.

Content: The syllabus for this boot camp will include:

* using the shell to do more in less time
* using version control to manage and share information
* basic Python programming
* how (and how much) to test programs
