The new Galaxy wiki includes a [Galaxy Events](/src/events/index.md) page that lists any upcoming events (such as [ISMB/ECCB 2011](/src/events/ISMB-ECCB-BOSC 2011/index.md) and the [Workshop on Comparative Genomics](http://www.molecularevolution.org/workshops/WCG#wcgna)) that have Galaxy related content.

The page also contains a link to the new [Galaxy Events Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mq93blfvdoosh5unpmivu4kh1c%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York), that lists events and deadlines that may be of interest to the Galaxy community.  For example, this week there are 5+ events going on and these 5 deadlines as well:
* [PSB](http://psb.stanford.edu/) abstracts (Monday)
* [Beyond the Genome](http://www.beyond-the-genome.com/program.html) abstract and early registration (Friday)
* [GIW 2011](http://www.kobic.re.kr/giw2011/) abstracts (Friday)
* [Computational & Comparative Genomics Course](http://meetings.cshl.edu/courses/c-ecg11.shtml) application (Friday)
* [Advanced Sequencing Technologies & Applications Course](http://meetings.cshl.edu/courses/c-seqtech11.shtml) application (Friday)

If you know of events that either have significant Galaxy content, or are of interest to the overall community, please send them to outreach@galaxyproject.org and they will be added to the [Events](/src/events/index.md) page and the calendar.
