A collaboration between the [Genomics Education Partnership (GEP)](http://gep.wustl.edu) and the [Galaxy project](https://galaxyproject.org/), the [G-OnRamp Project](http://gonramp.org) aims to enable educators and researchers to create genome browsers for collaborative annotations of eukaryotic genomes. G-OnRamp uses Galaxy workflows to construct evidence tracks (e.g., protein sequence similarity, gene predictions, RNA-Seq, repeats) and display the results on the [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/) or [JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org/). Educators can use G-OnRamp for hands-on learning in data-intensive biology; researchers can use G-OnRamp for best-practice annotation of novel genomes.

*We will hold two beta testers workshops this summer on June 20-22 and July 25-27, 2017 at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/)* that will demonstrate how you can use G-OnRamp to create genome browsers for your favorite genomes. To receive future announcements regarding registration for these G-OnRamp workshops, please [register your interest](http://gonramp.org/signup).  Travel and local costs are supported by NIH BD2K grant 1R25GM119157.  Questions can be directed to [Jeremy Goecks](mailto:goecksj@ohsu.edu) (Galaxy), or [Sarah Elgin](mailto:selgin@wustl.edu) (GEP).
