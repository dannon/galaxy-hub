Today we officially launch the [Galaxy Australia](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/galaxyaustralia/) community with the opening of registrations for the Galaxy Australasia Meeting 2017 (GAMe 2017) being held in Melbourne over 3-9 February. Australian Galaxy users and administrators will now have more opportunities to interact and collaborate to identify and address the needs of the local community. The community will also be a hub for Australian Galaxy training courses and offer a catalog of Australian Galaxy servers.

The establishment of Galaxy Australia is supported by the [EMBL Australia Bioinformatics Resource (EMBL-ABR)](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/) in its appointed role of supporting the development of skills and training in the Australian life science research community. At the EMBL-ABR Hub, hosted at the Victorian Life Sciences Computation Initiative (VLSCI), Galaxy is used extensively for teaching and data analysis directly as well as through the Australian-made [Genomics Virtual Laboratory](https://www.genome.edu.au/). VLSCI’s expert bioinformaticians and professional staff will help promote community activities and training.

This meeting will bring together biomedical researchers, bioinformaticians, infrastructure providers, and data producers from across Australia and Asia to share expertise across many levels.

The [conference](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/conference/) starts 4 February and features two full days of keynotes, accepted and sponsor talks, poster and sponsor sessions, birds­-of-­a­-feather gatherings, a conference dinner and lots of opportunities for networking.

Prior to the conference we are offering a [Researcher Training Day](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/training-day/) on 3 February, aimed at biomedical researchers who need to analyse their biological data. The conference is followed by a [four day workshop on Galaxy server administration](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/training-for-admin-workshop/) for those working at that level.

[Talk abstracts are due 30 November](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/submit-your-talkposter/) and [early registration ends 31 December](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/registration/).
