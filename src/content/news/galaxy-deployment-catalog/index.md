We are pleased to announce the [Galaxy Deployment Catalog](/src/community/deployments/index.md), a place to describe individual Galaxy deployments, and to learn how others in the community are implementing Galaxy in production environments.

If you have a Galaxy deployment then please take a few minutes to describe your instance to the community.  There are two ways to do this.

**[Use the Wiki Template](/src/community/deployments/index.md#using-the-wiki):**

   Go to the "[Using the Wiki](/src/community/deployments/index.md#using-the-wiki)" section of the [catalog home page](/src/community/deployments/index.md), enter a CamelCase name for your deployment, click "Create ...," and then edit, preview, and save the page. Voil√†, an entry for your deployment now exists in the [catalog](/src/community/deployments/index.md).  

**[Use the Online Form](http://bit.ly/gxydeployform)**

   [Fill out this online form](http://bit.ly/gxydeployform).  In a week or two, a deployment catalog page will be programmatically created and you will receive an email.  

The wiki method requires a wiki login, but gives you control over how the page appears. The online form is easier.

Thanks a bunch, and please let us know if you have any questions.
