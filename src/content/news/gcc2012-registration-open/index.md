We are pleased to announce that [early registration](/src/events/gcc2012/register/index.md) for the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](/src/events/gcc2012/index.md) is now open.  GCC2012 will be held July 25-27, at the [UIC Forum](http://www.uic.edu/depts/uicforum/), in Chicago, Illinois.  The conference will feature [two full days](/src/events/gcc2012/program /index.md) of presentations, discussions, lightning talks, and breakouts.  We have also added a new [full day of training](/src/events/gcc2012/training-day/index.md) this year, featuring 3 parallel tracks with four workshops each, covering seven different topics.

The Galaxy Community Conference is for:
* Sequencing core facility staff
* Bioinformatics core staff
* Bioinformatics tool and workflow developers
* Bioinformatics focused principal investigators and researchers
* Data producers
* Power bioinformatics users 

This event will help you with integrating, analyzing, and sharing the diverse and very large datasets that are now typical in biomedical research.  GCC2012 is an opportunity to share best practices with, and learn from, a large community of researchers and support staff who are facing the challenges of data-intensive biology. 

[Registration](/src/events/gcc2012/register/index.md) is very affordable this year, especially for post-docs and students. You can can save an additional 40% by registering on or before June 11.  

Conference [lodging](/src/events/gcc2012/logistics/index.md#lodging) can also be booked.  Low-cost rooms have been reserved [on the UIC campus](/src/events/gcc2012/logistics/index.md#james-stuckel-towers).  You can also stay at the [official conference hotel](/src/events/gcc2012/logistics/index.md#crowne-plaza-chicago-metro-downtown), at a substantial discount arranged for conference attendees.  There are a limited rooms available in both, and you are encouraged to [register early](/src/events/gcc2012/register/index.md), if you would like to stay in either.

Finally, [abstract submission](/src/events/gcc2012/abstracts/index.md) is also open, from now through April 16.  [Abstracts](/src/events/gcc2012/abstracts/index.md) on any topic of interest to the Galaxy community are strongly encouraged.  See the [Abstracts](/src/events/gcc2012/abstracts/index.md) page for details.

Looking forward to seeing you in Chicago!
