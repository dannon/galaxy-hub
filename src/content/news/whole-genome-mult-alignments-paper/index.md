A new paper, "[Making whole genome multiple alignments usable for biologists](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/07/19/bioinformatics.btr398.abstract)," by [Daniel Blankenberg](/src/people/dan/index.md), *[et al](/src/galaxy-team/index.md).* has been published (early access) in *[Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/)*.  The paper describes "a set of tools implemented within the Galaxy platform designed to make analysis of multiple genome alignments truly accessible for biologists. These tools are available through both a web-based graphical user interface and a command-line interface."  

The methods are [described on a Galaxy Page](http://usegalaxy.org/u/dan/p/maf) as well.
