**Want your own Galaxy server, for free?** You can now easily create Galaxy servers on the new [NSF Jetstream cloud](http://jetstream-cloud.org/). Each server comes preconfigured with hundreds of tools and commonly used reference datasets. It only takes a couple of minutes to start one. Once running, you can use it or change it up any way you like.

### How do I get access?

You must be a US-based academic to access Jetstream cloud. Access is free but it is necessary to have an XSEDE account (go to https://www.xsede.org/ to sign up) and have an active resource allocation. Getting the resource allocation is matter of writing a summary of your research in less than 100 words and waiting ~24 hrs for the application to get approved. Go to http://jetstream-cloud.org/allocations.php → "Submit and manage allocation requests" to get started; choose *Startup* type of allocation.

### How do I launch my own Galaxy server?

After you have your XSEDE account and an active allocation:
1. Visit https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/
2. Browse the available images and choose "Galaxy Standalone"
3. Follow the prompts on the screen to launch an instance
4. In less than 5 minutes, you should have your own, fully configured Galaxy server

More documentation about the process can be found on Galaxy’s wiki: https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Cloud/Jetstream
