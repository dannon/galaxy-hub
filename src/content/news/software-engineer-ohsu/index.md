[OHSU](http://ohsu.edu) is ranked as one of the nation’s top biomedical institutions in patient care, research, and education, with an annual operating budget of over $2.3 billion, over $340 million in annual grant funding, over 4,000 students and trainees, and nearly 1 million patient visits per year. Multiple departments rank among the top 5 in annual grant funding, including neuroscience, microbiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and emergency medicine. OHSU is one of the nation’s fastest growing biomedical institutions, bolstered by long-term resource commitments, such as the $1 billion Phil and Penny Knight “challenge” to support research in OHSU’s Knight Cancer Institute, led by Dr. Brian Druker, who pioneered the concept of gene targeted therapy by demonstrating the efficacy of the revolutionary cancer drug Gleevec in chronic myelogenous leukemia. OHSU provides substantial resources to enable data intensive science, including a world-class exascale supercomputing cluster, close interactions and resource commitments by leading technology companies such as Intel, tight integration with clinical and basic research programs across campus, graduate training programs in quantitative biosciences, biostatistics, biomedical informatics, bioinformatics and computational biology, and substantial long-term resource commitments, including the $1 billion Phil and Penny Knight "challenge" to support cancer research, with a significant focus on computation.
