[Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics](http://www.ie-freiburg.mpg.de/jobs) in Freiburg, Germany has an opening for a Bioinformatician for an initial period of two years.  The successful candidate will work at the interface between an in-house deep-sequencing facility (HiSeq-2500) and the various research groups at the institute. Main responsibilities include

* primary analysis of deep-sequencing data and quality controls
* maintenance and extension of existing analysis pipelines
* data and software management for the Bioinformatics Group
* training and consulting

Most of the above tasks are executed within the context of our Galaxy platform that will have to be administrated and further developed. There will be ample opportunities for direct collaborations with research groups and methodological developments.

See the [full job posting](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/news/bioinformatician-freiburg2014/FreiburgJobPosting.pdf) for further details.

[The Bioinformatics group](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de//?en) in Freiburg, Germany recruiting creative and motivated PhD students, postdoctoral
scholars or software engineers with a strong interest in RNA and NGS
related bioinformatics. PhD students will work in one of our research
projects and get an insight into RNA-Bioinformatics and NGS, while
postdocs will have the opportunity to furthermore define their own
research agenda.

Our lab has two main research areas:
* The Galaxy project, which is an open, web-based platform to support
  computational biomedical research. We are integrating new tools as well
  as interactive visualizations into Galaxy and working closely together
  with Galaxy community. Besides our strong NGS focus we are also driving
  the development of a cheminformatic Galaxy workbench. This project is
  highly community- and cooperation driven, with partners from industry
  and academic.
* RNA research, which includes local sequence-structure and multiple
  alignment of RNA, RNA folding, energy landscapes for RNA and also
  protein design and protein-protein Interactions.

Candidates should have a background in one or more of the following
areas: genomics, computer science, visualization, or bioinformatics. A
strong interest in programming and software development is as crucial as
being passioned to solve scientific problems.
Our lab is located in Freiburg, a beautiful university city in the south
west of Germany with the Black Forest, France and Switzerland just
around the corner and excellent research facilities all over the city.
