# Workflow Variables

[Back to Advanced Workflow](/src/learn/advanced-workflow/index.md)

## Where are variables used?

Variables are used in the editor in the far right panel, under the section "Edit Step Actions".


## How to identify the input datasets variables?

The screenshot allows us to visualize that the Tophat2 tool is selected and configured to expect 2 .fastq files. In the far right panel, when we search for 'Data input', the input variables appear right in front of it between quotes. (eg. **RNA-Seq FASTQ file, forward reads** Data input 'input1' (fastqsanger)). Therefore the input variables for .fastq files are input1 and input2.

## Usage

Variable syntax: ` #{input_name} `

Full usage:
```

Proper syntax is:  #{input_file_variable | option 1 | option n}

      where
         input_file_variable = is the name of an module input variable ("input_name" is supported)
         |  = the delimiter for added options. Optional if no options

      options = basename, upper, lower
         basename = keep all of the file name except the extension
                    (everything before the final ".")
         upper = force the file name to upper case
         lower = force the file name to lower case

```



## Rename output based on specified content

When you run a tool, the result will be new boxes on the 'History' panel with names like '42 Tophat2 on data 27 and data 26: accepted_hits'. It can be hard to keep track if you're running tens of samples using a workflow. You can rename the output based on the original input file name. In the section **Edit Step Actions**, you select 'Rename Dataset', choose the output and provide a new name. The new names can contain variables in order to tag the output. The screenshot shows the **accepted_hits** output being renamed to **` #{input_name} `**. For example, if your input filename is **sample42.fastq** the accepted_hits output will be named **sample42.fastq.bam**.
