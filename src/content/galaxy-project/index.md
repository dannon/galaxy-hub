# About Galaxy Project

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and	transparent computational biomedical research.		

- **Accessible:** Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters and run tools and workflows.		
-  **Reproducible:** Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis.
- **Transparent:** Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages, interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.		
 
See the [Learn](/src/learn/index.md) page for help on using Galaxy, and the [Admin](/src/admin/index.md) page for help on setting up your own instance.
