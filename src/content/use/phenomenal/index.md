  - '"The [PhenoMeNal Galaxy installation](http://public.phenomenal-h2020.eu/) allows users to access all of the [PhenoMeNal](http://phenomenal-h2020.eu/home/) containerised tools through a workflow environment, on an scalable infrastructure that can be deployed to public and private cloud installations."'
  - 'This PhenoMeNal H2020 Galaxy instance, and all of its tools, run as containers on top of [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), an open source container orchestrator system backed by Google. If you wish to [deploy the PhenoMeNal Galaxy installation](https://github.com/phnmnl/docker-galaxy-k8s-runtime/tree/develop) on top of your own [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) instance, you can find instructions at our [wiki](http://phenomenal-h2020.eu/home/wiki/#galaxy-with-k8s).'
