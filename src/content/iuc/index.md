## Introduction

<img class="float-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/iuc-logo-trans.png" alt="Intergalactic Utilities Commission" width="250" />

The Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC) was established in 2012 to enable the pervasive use of the main Galaxy [Tool Shed](/src/toolshed/index.md) by ensuring the repositories available include contents that are functionally correct and optimized for installation into local Galaxies.  When appropriate, the group provides guidance to [Galaxy tool](/src/tools/index.md) developers so that they can improve the quality of their repositories.

## Activities

* Maintains a set of high quality Galaxy tools in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc). This repo serves as an excellent example and inspiration to all Galaxy tool developers.
* Cultivates and shares the Galaxy tool development best practices [document](http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/).
* Provides support to tool developers on a public Gitter [channel](https://gitter.im/galaxy-iuc/iuc).
