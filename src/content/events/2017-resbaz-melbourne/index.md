The workshop introduces concept of differential gene expression analysis with nextGen sequencing data, or RNA-Seq, using Galaxy platform. Galaxy has a user friendly interface and does not require programming or knowledge of unix for data analysis. The workshop is aimed for new Galaxy users with little or no experience in genomics or high-throughput sequencing.
