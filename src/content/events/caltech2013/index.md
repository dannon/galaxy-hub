**Galaxy** is an open, web-based platform for *accessible, reproducible*, and *transparent* computational biomedical research.

* **Accessible:** Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters and run tools and workflows.
* **Reproducible:** Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis.
* **Transparent:** Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages, interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.

There will be two Galaxy-related events on the Caltech Campus on March 5, 2013: a [Galaxy for Biologists Workshop](/src/events/caltech2013/index.md#workshop-galaxy-for-biologists) in the morning, and a [discussion on Galaxy Development](/src/events/caltech2013/index.md#discussion-galaxy-for-developers) in the afternoon.

## Workshop: Galaxy for Biologists

<div class='indent'>
**11am-2pm, March 5, 2013, 151 Braun** (lunch provided for participants)<br />
**[Slides](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/documents/presentations/2013CaltechGalaxyForBiologists.pdf)**<br />

Galaxy: learn to use this bioinformatics work environment.

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

This hands-on workshop will teach participants how to integrate data, and perform simple and complex analysis within Galaxy. It will also cover data visualization and visual analytics, and how to share and reuse your bioinformatic analyses, all from within Galaxy.

**Please bring a wifi-enabled laptop with a current web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE9) installed on it.** No programming or Linux command line experience is required.

## Discussion: Galaxy for Developers

<div class='indent'>
**2:30-4:30pm, March 5, BBB 024** (note revised time, new location) <br />
**[Dave Clements](/src/people/dave-clements/index.md)**<br />
**Emory University**<br /><br />

This informal discussion will introduce Galaxy for developers.  We will discuss any items of interest to attendees and answer questions relating to, for example, the Galaxy API, Galaxy Architecture, configuring Galaxy for a production environment, and anything else about Galaxy. This will be more informal than the *Galaxy for Biologists* workshop and will cover topics that are of most interest to attendees. [Dave Clements](/src/people/dave-clements/index.md) of the Galaxy Project will lead the workshop and we will be joined remotely by [Dannon Baker](/src/people/dannon-baker/index.md) and [Nate Coraor](/src/people/nate/index.md), two members of the [core Galaxy development team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md).

*This discussion is open to any member of the Caltech community. It is free, but space is limited and advanced registration is strongly encouraged.*
