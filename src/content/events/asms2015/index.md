## Workshop 4:  The Galaxy Framework for MS-based Informatics

**Monday, 5:45-7:00 PM, Room 123/124 <br />
Tim Griffin (presiding), University of Minnesota**

This workshop will provide attendees a look at some emerging applications in biological MS that are challenging to researchers, and where Galaxy offers an informatics solution. Informal presentations will be given by experts on these applications, with a focus on providing useful details on how these software and workflows can be accessed and used immediately. Audience  questions and discussion on usability and other issues will be fielded and facilitated. An informal panel discussion with the presenters will follow the presentations.

Presenters and expected topics will include:


| Talk |  Topic  |  Speaker  |  Links  | 
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ------ | 
| 1. |  **The Proteoformer Pipeline for RiboProfiling and MS-based Proteomics**  |  Gerben Menschaert, Ghent University  |   | 
| 2. |  **Galaxy-based PeptideShaker tools and applications, with a focus on downstream applications**  |  [Ira Cooke](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/staff-profiles/show-profile-remote-content.php?uname=ICooke), La Trobe University / [Pratik Jagtap](http://cbs.umn.edu/contacts/pratik-d-jagtap), University of Minnesota  |  [Slides](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/documents/presentations/2015_ASMS_PeptideShaker_Cooke_Jagtap.pdf)  | 
| 3. |  **Targeted Proteomics tools in Galaxy**  |  Shyamasree Saha, Queen Mary University of London  |   | 

Ample time will be offered for questions from attendees and discussion. Presenters will be available for an informal panel discussion in the final part of the workshop.
