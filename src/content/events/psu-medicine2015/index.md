## Registration

[Registration](http://bit.ly/gxyhershey2015reg) is free. Affiliation with Penn State is not required, unless the workshop is oversubscribed, in which case preference will be given to registrants from Penn State.  Capacity is limited so you are encouraged to register now.

## Audience

Are you a biomedical researcher who needs to do complex analysis on large datasets?

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive life science research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

This hands-on workshop will teach participants how to integrate data, and perform simple and complex analysis within Galaxy in domains such as variation, RNA-Seq / differential expression, and metagenomics.  It will also cover data visualization and visual analytics, and how to share and reuse your bioinformatic analyses, all from within Galaxy.

No programming or Linux command line experience is required.
