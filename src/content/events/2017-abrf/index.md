Metaproteomics analysis is emerging as an effective approach for identifying
microorganisms and functional role of the microbiome in response to environment
or host-physiology. Metaproteomics characterizes proteins expressed by
microorganism communities (microbiome) present in environmental samples or a
host organism. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based metaproteomics has catalyzed new
discoveries into the functional dynamics of microbiomes (Wilmes et al 2015,
doi: 10.1002/pmic.201500183). Metaproteomic informatics is distinctly
challenging due to the large databases and complex processing steps involved.
This challenge limits widespread use of metaproteomics. Through modular
workflows, we demonstrate the use of the Galaxy bioinformatics framework as a
metaproteomic informatics solution. Our results demonstrate the power of
discovery metaproteomics to add functional understanding to microbiomes, beyond
what is possible using traditional metagenomic approaches.
