This page describes the **Galaxy Clinical Use Survey / Filesystems and HPC** [Birds of a Feather](/src/events/gcc2013/bof/index.md) meetup being held at [GCC2013](/src/events/gcc2013/index.md).

The need for a process-level source and version control, configuration management and document life-cycle management system is reaching a critical path as Research Genomics translates into Clinical Genomics. We will continue discussing the architectural and storage requirements for using Galaxy, the process management platform of choice for Genomics, in a Clinical environment.

We had a general discussion regarding a “reference platform” for Galaxy and Parallel File Systems.  More to come ...

## When and Where

We [time and location](/src/events/gcc2013/bof/index.md#bof-schedule) will meet on Tuesday over lunch in the Cantina.
