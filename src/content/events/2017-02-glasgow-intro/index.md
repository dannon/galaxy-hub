Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biological research
that enables researchers to create, run, tune, and share their own
bioinformatic analysis. The workshop will teach attendees the basics of Galaxy
including the interface, using tools and creating, extracting and modifying
workflows. Attendees will be guided through three working examples in Galaxy:
variant calling, differential expression analysis and workflow creation and
editing. At the end of the course, attendees will be able to utilize the Galaxy
platform to perform their own analysis and generate their own reproducible and
shareable workflows.
