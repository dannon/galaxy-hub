On the second day of the [Swiss German Galaxy Days 2016](/src/events/sg2016/index.md), we will organize a Galaxy Developer Day in Freiburg.


## Location

The developer day will be held at the Universität of Freiburg

## Schedule

We will start at 9:30 on Friday as well. There will be no fixed schedule, 
but we expect to finish between 5 and 6pm.

## Ideas

The second day is the traditional developers day and we are planning to
have 3 to 4 hands-on sessions (1.5h). Every session will start with a 10
minute talk and theoretical introduction, followed by 1h of hacking and
20 minutes discussion and a small break until the next session begins.
We have a few proposed and prepared topics but we are flexible so we can
discover new areas of the Galaxy.

Proposed topics:
* ‘expand’ reports tool (API, Galaxy DB, JS)
* Creating Conda packages and Docker containers (Conda, Docker, Tools)
* Creating new Galaxy Docker flavours (Docker, Admin)
* Enhancing training with Galaxy tours (JS, Training)

Please let us know what you are interesting in.
