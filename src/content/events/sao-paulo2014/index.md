The course is hosted by the **[Institute of Biomedical Science at University of São Paulo (USP)](http://www3.icb.usp.br/corpoeditorial/)** and will take place at the **[CEFAP](http://cefap.icb.usp.br/en) [main auditorium](http://cefap.icb.usp.br/core-facilities/anfiteatro/)**.

The [CEFAP](http://cefap.icb.usp.br/en) in collaboration with the [Brazilian Society of Immunology](http://www.sbi.org.br/) will host this workshop at no cost to researchers who require training in NGS data analysis. Note, catering will not be provided for the course, but the institute has one cafeteria where participants can purchase refreshments. The workshop is open to all researchers and graduate students. Admission is competitive and will be based on the strength of your application.

Each applicant is required to submit a detailed motivation outlining how the course will contribute to their current research. Preference will be given to those who have already generated data which requires further analysis.

## Audience

Are you a life scientist who needs to do complex analysis on large datasets?

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive life science research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

This hands-on workshop will teach participants how to integrate data, and perform simple and complex analysis within Galaxy.  It will also cover data visualization and visual analytics, and how to share and reuse your bioinformatic analyses, all from within Galaxy.

No programming or Linux command line experience is required.

## Platform

Hands-on exercises will be run on the University of São Paulo's compute cloud *[Nuvem](https://wiki.uspdigital.usp.br/nuvem/)*.  The USP cloud is based on a [Citrix cloud architecture](http://www.citrix.com/products/cloudplatform/overview.html).
