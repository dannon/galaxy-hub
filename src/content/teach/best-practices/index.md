# Use the Best Compute Platform

The [Computing Platforms page](/src/teach/computing-platforms/index.md) includes options and recommendations for computing backends with which to teach Galaxy.

# Use Galaxy's Built-In Mechanisms

Galaxy has several mechanisms that make teaching Galaxy and bioinformatics easier. Using these capabilities during a workshop or course is a natural way to demonstrate them.

## Published histories, workflows, and visualizations

Pre-populate teaching Galaxy instances with published histories, workflows, and visualizations that users can refer to for guidance or  import into their workspace. Published objects can be easily accessed under the **Shared** tab on all Galaxy instances. 

## Data libraries

Avoid training-time dependencies on external resources (that may be down during training) and swamping your local network by pre-loading data into **Data Libraries** on the training server. To do this, you will need either admin access to the server or the cooperation of the server's admin. For more details on how to become a Galaxy admin, check out this [guide](https://new.galaxyproject.org/admin/).

## Licensing

License all materials under CC-BY to makes things much easier.

# Use Established Training Techniques

## General best practices

Below are a list of best practices that may be helpful for any Galaxy training session.

### Start with a specific exercise

Start with an exercise where users are told exactly what to do. Then, open it up to give users an opportunity to try things for themselves.

### Introduce conceptually simple material when covering NGS

Start with assembly and/or mapping exercises. These concepts are typically easier for new users to understand than, for example, a complex RNA-Seq or ChIP-Seq analysis workflow.

### Let the users be teachers

Structure a course by pairing one user with a computing background and one user with a biological or medical background. This pairing allows biologists to pick up general computer interaction skills and computer scientists to gain an appreciation for the motivation behind a particular analysis.

### Utilize skills of computer scientists

Ask tech- or computer-savvy users to be teaching assistants. They may not be familiar with Galaxy or the biology, but they are familiar with computers and are already aware that `cAsE` may matter, for example, or that tabs and spaces are treated differently.

### Create online communities

Set up a mailing list or Google Group for every training session. Establishing a network for users who know each other offers a much less intimidating environment than public boards.

## Workshop-specific best practices

Below are a list of best practices that may be helpful when doing a workshop where you only have a limited number of hours or days to teach the material, and you are always in the classroom with the users.

## Course-specific best practices

Below are a list of best practices that may be helpful when teaching an academic course using Galaxy. In this case, users may be using Galaxy in a lab and for homework, but there are also contact hours where hands-on exercises are not the focus.
