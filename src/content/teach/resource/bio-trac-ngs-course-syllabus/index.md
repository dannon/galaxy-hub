This is the syllabus for a [popular NGS workshop](http://www.biotrac.com/pages/Tracs/Trac45.html) that heavily uses Galaxy as a teaching tool.  If there seems to be interest, we intend to add specific tutorials.

## Needed Tools

For the Galaxy component, we work through an Amazon cloud deployment of Galaxy, with the SRA_toolkit installed from the main toolshed.  I can post the AMI for the command line component upon request.

## Datasets

We use very small *c elegans* datasets.  This allows us to host many students in parallel.  Posted upon request.
