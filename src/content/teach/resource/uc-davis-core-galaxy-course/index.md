## Needed Tools

The easiest way to use this material is launch the workshop's [accompanying Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](/src/teach/resource/uc-davis-core-ami/index.md).  It has all needed tools already installed on it.

## Datasets

The [workshop AMI](/src/teach/resource/uc-davis-core-ami/index.md) also includes the example datasets used in the exercises.
