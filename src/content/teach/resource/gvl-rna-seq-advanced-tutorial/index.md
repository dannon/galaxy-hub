This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/), a [public Galaxy server](/src/use/index.md) specifically for learning bioinformatics analysis.

In this tutorial we compare the performance of three statistically-based differential expression tools:
* [CuffDiff](/src/CuffDiff/index.md)
* EdgeR
* DESeq2

## Needed Tools

This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/).  All needed tools are on the server.

## Datasets

"The data for this tutorial is from the paper, [A comprehensive comparison of RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis from reads to differential gene expression and cross-comparison with microarrays: a case study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by Nookaew et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3488244/) which studies S.cerevisiae strain CEN.PK 113-7D (yeast) under two different metabolic conditions: glucose-excess (batch) or glucose-limited (chemostat).
The RNA-Seq data has been uploaded in NCBI, short read archive (SRA), with accession SRS307298. There are 6 samples in total having two treatments with three biological replicates each. The data is paired-end.
Batch: Batch1 = SRR453566 , Batch2 = SRR453567, Batch3 = SRR453568
Chemostat: Chem1 = SRR453569, Chem2 = SRR453570, Chem3 = SRR453571
"

Needed datasets exist in Shared Libraries on the server, and are also available via URL.
