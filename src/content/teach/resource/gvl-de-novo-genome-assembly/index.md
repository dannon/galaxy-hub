This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/), a [public Galaxy server](/src/use/index.md) specifically for learning bioinformatics analysis.

In this tutorial we carry out de novo assembly of a microbial genome.

## Needed Tools

This tutorial runs on the [GVL Galaxy Tutorial Server](http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/).  All needed tools are on the server.

## Datasets

Needed datasets exist in Shared Libraries on the server, and are also available via URL.

The data for this tutorial is from a whole genome sequencing experiment of a multi-drug resistant strain of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The DNA was sequenced using an Illumina GAII sequencing machine. The data we are going to use consists of about 4 million x 75 base-pair, paired end reads (two FASTQ read files, one for each end of a DNA fragment.) The data was downloaded from the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/). The specific sample is a public dataset published in April 2012 with SRA accession number ERR048396.
