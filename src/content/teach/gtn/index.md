The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/teach/gtn/index.md) is a network of people and groups that present Galaxy and Galaxy-based training around the world.  GTN helps researchers find online training material, and trainers in their geographic area, and helps advertise [training events](/src/events/index.md) as well.

These pages describes the Galaxy Training Network, and everything else related to teaching Galaxy or teaching Bioinformatics with Galaxy:

## Training Resources Directory

The **[Training Resources Directory](https://training.galaxyproject.org/)** is a catalog of training resources for Galaxy.  *Training resources* include tutorials, slides, virtual machines, and entire workshop packages that can be used to teach with Galaxy. Training materials can be created and updated on the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material).

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Have you created or know of a resource that is useful for teaching with Galaxy? Then please share it! This will help others and also help get the word out about your resource. Use [this Google form](http://bit.ly/gxytrainresourceform) to describe your resource.

## Trainer Directory

Looking for someone to teach bioinformatics and Galaxy at a workshop or your institution?  Perhaps you are someone who teaches Galaxy and would be interested in helping others teach it, or in teaching Galaxy to other groups?  The **[Galaxy Trainer Directory](/src/teach/trainers/index.md)** lists everyone who is interested in training in their region, or even around the world.  

## Compute Platform Advice

Wondering what kind of platform you'll need for a successful training event?  See the **[Computing Platforms page](/src/teach/computing-platforms/index.md)** for advice of what works and does not work in different situations.

## Best Practices

Learn from experienced trainers and share what you have learned on the **[Galaxy Training Best Practices page](/src/teach/best-practices/index.md)**.  

## Mailing List

The [Galaxy-Training mailing list](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/galaxy-training.lists.galaxyproject.org/) is the place to post questions and announcements related to Galaxy training.  It is also the official mailing list of the GTN.

## Events

Want to know what training events are scheduled in the coming months?  Or publish your event on the list?  See the **[Galaxy Events page](/src/events/index.md)** which lists all known upcoming Galaxy events, including many training events.
