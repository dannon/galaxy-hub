This is the *hub page* for information about how to teach bioinformatics using
Galaxy, and Galaxy itself.  If you are interested in Galaxy training there are
[resources](/src/teach/resources/index.md),
[trainers](/src/teach/trainers/index.md), [compute platform
advice](/src/teach/computing-platforms/index.md), [best
practices](/src/teach/best-practices/index.md), and the [Galaxy Training
Network](/src/teach/gtn/index.md) are here to help.

## Training Resources Directory

The **[Training Resources Directory](/src/teach/resources/index.md)** is a
catalog of training resources for Galaxy.  Training resources include
tutorials, slides, virtual machines, and entire workshop packages that can be
used to teach with Galaxy.

There is also an [easy way to add new
resources](/src/teach/resources/index.md#add-a-training-resource) to the
directory.

## Trainer Directory

Looking for someone to teach bioinformatics and Galaxy at a workshop or your
institution?  Perhaps you are someone who teaches Galaxy and would be
interested in helping others teach it, or in teaching Galaxy to other groups?
The **[Galaxy Trainer Directory](/src/teach/trainers/index.md)** lists everyone
who is interested in training in their region, or even around the world.

## Compute Platform Advice

for advice of what works and does not work in different situations.

## Best Practices

Learn from experienced trainers and share what you have learned on the
**[Galaxy Training Best Practices page](/src/teach/best-practices/index.md)**.

## Survey

Help us improve our training materials on RNAseq Analysis with this
**[RNAseq analysis survey](/src/teach/survey/rnaseq2017/index.md)** !

## Events

Want to know what training events are scheduled in the coming months?  Or
publish your event on the list?  See the **[Galaxy Events
page](/src/events/index.md)** which lists all known upcoming Galaxy events,
including many training events.

## Contact

If you have a question about [teaching bioinformatics with Galaxy, or about
teaching Galaxy itself](/src/teach/index.md), then the
[Galaxy-Training](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/galaxy-training.lists.galaxyproject.org/)
mailing list is a good place to find an answer.  This is also the official
mailing list of the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/teach/gtn/index.md).
