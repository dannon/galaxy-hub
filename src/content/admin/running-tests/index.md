title: Running Tests
---
Galaxy is a large code base with many different test types.

Assuming Galaxy has been downloaded and installed (see [Admin/Get Galaxy](/src/admin/get-galaxy/index.md)), the directory containing Galaxy also contains the shell script `run_tests.sh`. Running this script using `sh run_tests.sh --help` generates the most up-to-date description of Galaxy test types, where to find them, their configuration options, and how to execute them.
