For admins wishing to have more information on the status of their galaxy instance, you can configure and run the Galaxy Report. This separate application will give you insights in your instance's usage and load. It aims to present data about users, jobs, workflows, disk space, and much more.

Setup details can be found in the [admin section](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/reports.html) of the code documentation.
