Before starting Cloudgene, it is necessary to start [Cloudera Manager](/src/cloudman/services/cloudera-manager/index.md) service first. Once it is running, start the Cloudgene service. Both of these services can be started via CloudMan's Admin page by clicking on *Start* next to the service name. Once running, the application is available under */cloudgene* URI.

For more info about Cloudgene, please visit http://cloudgene.uibk.ac.at/ or check out more Cloudgene workflows at [Michigan Imputation Server](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/)  or  [mtDNA-Server](http://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at).
