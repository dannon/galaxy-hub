An overview of using the Mercurial revision control system with Galaxy.

There are a couple of primary use cases for Mercurial in Galaxy:

1. To get the latest copy of the Galaxy source code.
1. To update the code, and either contribute it back to the mainline Galaxy code, or to keep your own local updates.

## Bitbucket
Galaxy keeps it's source code in [../Bitbucket](/src/develop/bitbucket/index.md) ...

## Getting Mercurial
New users are strongly recommended to go through the [Mercurial tutorial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Tutorial), to install Mercurial and learn about the basic usage.

## Get the Latest From Galaxy-Central
## Make Local Changes
## Submitting Your Changes to Galaxy-Central
