## How to find tools

### Tools installed and availble on the Galaxy server in use

 * At the top of the left tool panel, type in a tool name or datatype into the tool search box. 
 * Shorter keywords find more choices. 
 * Tools can also be directly browsed by category in the tool panel.
 
### Can't find the tool you want? 

 * Try searching  the **[Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu)**. 
 * New tools are added all the time that can be used in **[local](/admin/get-galaxy/index.md)** or **[cloud](/src/cloudman/index.md)** Galaxy instances.
 * If the tool you want to use is not wrapped yet, it could be. 
   * Should you have development resource, wrapped tool contributions are welcome additions to the *[Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu)**
   * [Development Resources](/src/develop/index.md)
 * Requests to wrap tools can be made by opening an issue and assigning the tag `tool request` at the [IUC master repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)
