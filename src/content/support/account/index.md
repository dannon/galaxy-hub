# Registering for a Galaxy account

Having your own account on the public **[Test](/src/test/index.md)** and/or **[Main](/src/main/index.md)** server means that you can save histories, work with more data, and get the most out of Galaxy's functionality. 

Accounts are created under the **User** masthead menu. This same menu is also where you will log in and out of Galaxy.

Be sure to note that the public [Test](/src/test/index.md) and [Main](/src/main/index.md) instance **usage policies are <span class="red">one account per user<span class="grey"></span></span>**, as stated in our **[Terms and Conditions](https://usegalaxy.org/static/terms.html)**. Also, make sure your email address is valid so that you can confirm your new account (emails are case sensitive) and so that our administrator can contact you if needed (rare, but you'll want the email!).Â 

Admin settig up an instance? See our **[User Accounts](/src/authnz/config/gxy/index.md)** wiki for more help, or [different user authentication methods](/src/authnz).
