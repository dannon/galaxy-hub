Galaxy also has an *IRC channel* in which you can participate.  You can connect to the chat directly via browser  [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#galaxyproject). This IRC channel is an informal online gathering place for the Galaxy community to post questions and help each other out.  If you are unfamiliar with IRC, it is conducive to quick discussion, much like any other casual chat program.  There is also lots of [online help about IRC](http://www.irchelp.org/).

The #galaxyproject IRC channel has an [online public archive](https://botbot.me/freenode/galaxyproject/) (starting 2014/10/22) and these archives are included in the [Galaxy search engine](/src/search/index.md).
