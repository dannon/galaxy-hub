The  meetup's online conference room will open 15 minutes before the meetup.  The call will use [Johns Hopkins' Adobe Connect server](http://connect.johnshopkins.edu/welcome/), which in turn uses Adobe Flash.  You are encouraged to connect a few minutes early to work out any unexpected bumps.

### Instructions for Participants

* You can ask questions either by *raising your hand* or by typing the question in the chat box.  
  * If you raise your hand, the host will need to recognize you.
  * If you ask a question verbally, please wear headphones.  Not wearing headphones lead to unpleasant feedback.
