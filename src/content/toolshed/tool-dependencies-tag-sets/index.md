# Supported tool_dependencies.xml Tag Sets

* INSTALL\_DIR = installation directory (absolute path with no trailing slash), useful to pass it to ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL\_DIR or to set environment variables
* REPOSITORY\_INSTALL\_DIR = the directory (absolute path with no trailing slash) where your XML files are located (tool, or tool\_dependencies.xml XML files)
* TMP\_WORK\_DIR = temporary working directory (absolute path with no trailing slash) used during tool installation. All files are downloaded here, unpacked etc. This directory will be removed after installation
