Repositories in the Tool Shed can contain a file named **repository_dependencies.xml** that creates dependency relationships between repositories when installed into Galaxy.  Repository dependency definitions are currently supported only within the same Tool Shed.  In other words, a repository in a local Tool Shed cannot require a repository in the main Galaxy Tool Shed.
