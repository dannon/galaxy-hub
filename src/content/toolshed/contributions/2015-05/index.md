It uses a novel network flow algorithm as well as an optional de novo assembly step to assemble and quantitate full-length transcripts representing multiple splice variants for each gene locus. Its input can include not only the alignments of raw reads used by other transcript assemblers, but also alignments longer sequences that have been assembled from those reads.To identify differentially expressed genes between experiments, StringTie's output can be processed either by the Cuffdiff or Ballgown programs.

This will eat all your cluster node RAM and then some. hg19 uses about 30GB but it's really fast. See http://gettinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/star-ultrafast-universal-rna-seq-aligner.html You also need a new set of genome indexes. Sigh. So you have to build those yourself until I figure out how to make an index manager. Most of this wrapper was originally written by Jeremy Goecks, with kibbitzing and automated dependency installation by Ross Lazarus.
