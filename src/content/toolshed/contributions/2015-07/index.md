Utility for integrating sets of genomic features (e.g. canonical genes, CpG islands) with expression data  RnaChipIntegrator is a utility that performs integrated analyses of gene expression and ChIP data, identifying the nearest ChIP peaks to each transcript, and vice versa. Output of RnaChipIntegrator differs according to the criteria that are used to calculate the distances between ChIP peaks and transcripts.

* *From [devteam](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam):*
  * [kraken_translate](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/kraken_translate): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/blob/master/tool_collections/kraken/kraken_translate/ commit [00a7926c285bc4a339bd7deebf40b28f39c7d947](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/commit/00a7926c285bc4a339bd7deebf40b28f39c7d947)-dirty Contains a galaxy tool wrapper for the kraken-translate command. Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.
  * [data_manager_hisat_index_builder](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/data_manager_hisat_index_builder): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/tree/master/data_managers/data_manager_hisat_index_builder commit [5a7365750648c26206f05ac7956936c243c2b980](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/commit/5a7365750648c26206f05ac7956936c243c2b980) HISAT is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program. As part of HISAT, we have developed a new indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the FM index, called hierarchical indexing, that employs two types of indexes: (1) one global FM index representing the whole genome, and (2) many separate local FM indexes for small regions collectively covering the genome. Our hierarchical index for the human genome (about 3 billion bp) includes ~48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ~64,000bp. As the basis for non-gapped alignment, the FM index is extremely fast with a low memory footprint, as demonstrated by Bowtie. In addition, HISAT provides several alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping different types of RNA-seq reads. All these together, HISAT enables extremely fast and sensitive alignment of reads, in particular those spanning two exons or more. As a result, HISAT is much faster >50 times than TopHat2 with better alignment quality. Although it uses a large number of indexes, the memory requirement of HISAT is still modest, approximately 4.3 GB for human. HISAT uses the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index. In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT handles reads involving indels and supports a paired-end alignment mode. Multiple processor can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed. HISAT outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK) that use SAM. HISAT is distributed under the GPLv3 license, and it runs on the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

The UNAFold software package is an integrated collection of programs that simulate folding, hybridization, and melting pathways for one or two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences. The name is derived from "Unified Nucleic Acid Folding." Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is "command line" driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package. This evolving software is available for download at http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/hybrid/download.php .

Much of the ENCODE processed data is in this form, and it is appearing more often in GEO as well. The purpose of bwtool is to make these files more useful by providing some convenient functions.

  * [package_bwa_0_7_12](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/avowinkel/package_bwa_0_7_12): Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version 0.7.12 of the BWA package BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads. Li H. and Durbin R. (2009) Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform.

  * [package_mapsembler2_2_2_3](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/cmonjeau/package_mapsembler2_2_2_3): Imported from capsule None Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version 2.2.3 of Mapsembler2 Mapsembler2 is a targeted assembly software. It takes as input any number of NGS raw read set(s) (fasta or fastq, gzipped or not) and a set of input sequences (starters). For each starter, Mapsembler2 outputs its sequence neighborhood as a linear sequence or as a graph, depending on the user choice. Mapsembler2 may be used for (not limited to): \u00b7 Validate an assembled sequence (input as starter), e.g. from a de Bruijn graph assembly where read-coherence was not enforced. Checks if a known enzyme is present in a metagenomic NGS read set. \u00b7 Enrich unmappable reads by extending them, possibly making them mappable \u00b7 Checks what happens at the extremities of a contig \u00b7 Check the presence / absence and quantify RNA seq splicing events. Check the presence/absence of SNPs or structural variants, \u2026
  * [package_commet_24_07_14](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/cmonjeau/package_commet_24_07_14): Imported from capsule None Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version 24_07_14 of Commet COMMET (\u201cCOmpare Multiple METagenomes\u201d) provides a global similarity overview between all datasets of a large metagenomic project.Directly from non-assembled reads, all against all comparisons are performed through an efficient indexing strategy. Then, results are stored as bit vectors, a compressed representation of read files, that can be used to further combine read subsets by common logical operations. Finally, COMMET computes a clusterization of metagenomic datasets, which is visualized by dendrogram and heatmaps.

It is an exact local transcriptome assembler that allows to identify SNPs, indels and alternative splicing events. It can deal with an arbitrary number of biological conditions, and will quantify each variant in each condition. It has been tested on Illumina datasets of up to 1G reads. Its memory consumption is around 5Gb for 100M reads.
  * [package_lordec_0_5_3](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/cmonjeau/package_lordec_0_5_3): Imported from capsule None Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version 0.5.3 of Lordec LoRDEC is a program to correct sequencing errors in long reads from 3rd generation sequencing with high error rate, and is especially intended for PacBio reads. It uses a hybrid strategy, meaning that it uses two sets of reads: the reference read set, whose error rate is assumed to be small, and the PacBio read set, which is then corrected using the reference set. Typically, the reference set contains Illumina reads.
