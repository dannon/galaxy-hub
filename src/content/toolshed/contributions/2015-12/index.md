  * [genetrack](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/genetrack): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/genetrack  Contains a tool that separately identifies peaks on the forward "+" (W) and reverse "-" (C) strand. Contains a tool that separately identifies peaks on the forward "+" (W) and reverse "-" (C) strand. The centroid of read (tag) clusters represent a consensus nuclease stop point. To calculate the centroid or peak, clusters of tags are smoothed via a Gaussian distribution and the nearest coordinate at the peak is recorded. No other peak on the same strand is allowed to be called within a Â± bp distance of the peak as defined by the exclusion zone. The start and end of the exclusion zone is reported in the output dataset.
  * [bam_to_scidx](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/bam_to_scidx): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/bam_to_scidx  Contains a tool that converts a BAM file to an ScIdx file. Converts BAM data to ScIdx, the Strand-specific coordinate count format, which is used by tools within the Chip-exo Galaxy flavor. ScIdx files are 1-based. The format consists of 5 columns: the chromosome, the position of the genomic coordinate, the number of tags on the forward strand, the number of tags on the reverse strand and the number of total tags on the position. With pair-end reads, only the 5' end of READ1 will be used to create the ScIdx data file. Tools that use this format include GeneTrack and MultiGPS.

  * [meme_fimo](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/meme_fimo): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/meme  FIMO tool from the meme package The MEME Suite supports motif-based analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. It provides motif discovery algorithms using both probabilistic (MEME) and discrete models (MEME), which have complementary strengths. It also allows discovery of motifs with arbitrary insertions and deletions (GLAM2). In addition to motif discovery, the MEME Suite provides tools for scanning sequences for matches to motifs (FIMO, MAST and GLAM2Scan), scanning for clusters of motifs (MCAST), comparing motifs to known motifs (Tomtom), finding preferred spacings between motifs (SpaMo), predicting the biological roles of motifs (GOMo), measuring the positional enrichment of sequences for known motifs (CentriMo), and analyzing ChIP-seq and other large datasets (MEME-ChIP). The MEME Suite is comprised of a collection of tools that work together.
  * [repmatch_gff3](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/repmatch_gff3): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/repmatch_gff3  Contains a tool that matches corresponding peak-pair midpoints from separate datasets based on user-defined criteria. Contains a tool that requires 2 or more input datasets and discovers peak-pair midpoints the first dataset.It then looks up all peak-pair midpoints in a second dataset that are within a user-specified distance from the peak-pair midpoint coordinate in the first dataset. When encountering multiple candidates to match, it looks for a user-specified resolution method so that there is at most only a one-to-one match across the two datasets.

  * [cwpair2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/cwpair2): planemo upload for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/cwpair2 Contains a tool that takes a list of called peaks on both strands and produces a list of matched pairs and a list of unmatched orphans. Contains a tool that takes a list of called peaks on both strands and produces a list of matched pairs and a list of unmatched orphans. Nuclease stops (peaks) are expected to be on both strands at a fixed distance in the 5' direction from the site of crosslinking. By pairing peaks within an empirically imposed distance, False positive peaks can be removed. It can also specify the point of crosslinking.

* *From [cs76](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/cs76):*
  * [isotopologue_parameter_optimization](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/cs76/isotopologue_parameter_optimization): - version 0.1 Peak picking parameters optimization by using natural, stable 13C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. IPO optimizes XCMS peak picking parameters by using natural, stable 13C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing relative retention time differences within peak groups. Grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of peak groups that show one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiments, and the resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models. IPO was tested on three different data sets, each consisting of a training set and test set. IPO resulted in an increase of reliable groups (146% - 361%), a decrease of non-reliable groups (3% - 8%) and a decrease of the retention time deviation to one third.
