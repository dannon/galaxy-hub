# Tools

* *From [pjbriggs](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/pjbriggs):*
  * [weeder2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/pjbriggs/weeder2): Weeder2 is a program for finding novel motifs (transcription factor binding sites) conserved in a set of regulatory regions of related genes

* *From [iuc](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc):*
  * [bedtools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/bedtools): bedtools: a powerful toolset for genome arithmetic. Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF. While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining multiple bedtools operations.
