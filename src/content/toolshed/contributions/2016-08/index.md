  * [batchcorrection](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/melpetera/batchcorrection): [W4M][Metabolomics][LC-MS] Correction of data intensities for signal drift and batch-effects. Instrumental drift and offset differences between batches have been described in LC-MS experiments when the number of samples is large and/or multiple batches of acquisition are needed. Recently a normalization strategy relying on the measurements of a "pooled" (or QC) sample injected periodically has been described: for each variable, a regression model is fitted to the values of the "pool" and subsequently used to adjust the intensities of the samples of interest (van der Kloet et al, 2009; Dunn et al, 2011). The current repository contains two modules: "Determine batch correction" and "Batch correction". The "Batch correction" module provides two strategies for normalization: variables can be either first checked to assess which of them should be corrected (in that case the "Determine Batch Correction" module provides the information about the correction which will be applied), or all variables can be corrected ("all loess" options). In the latter case, it is possible to fit the model on the samples instead of the pools. Output figures and files are provided to assess the quality of the normalization.

* *From [ahosny](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ahosny):*
  * [cnvsim](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ahosny/cnvsim): initial CNV Sim for Galaxy (version 0.9.0) Generates a set of artificial DNA reads with Copy Number Variations (CNVs) In genomics, Copy Number Variations (CNVs) is a type of structural variation in a genome where sections of the genome are repeated. The number if repetitions (duplications) varies between individuals in the human population. The Copy Number Variation Simulator (CNV Sim) is a tool used to generate a set of artificial DNA fragments for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) read simulation. When aligned back to the reference genome, the artificial generated reads show variations in the CNV regions. Variations can be either amplifications of deletions. CNV-Sim offers two types of simulation:
    1. CNV simulation in whole genome. CNV-Sim wraps the functionality of ART to introduce variations in the genome.
    2. CNV simulation in whole exome. CNV-Sim wraps the functionality of Wessim to introduce variations in the targets.

* *From [ethevenot](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ethevenot):*
  * [qualitymetrics](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ethevenot/qualitymetrics): [W4M][Metabolomics][LC-MS] Metrics and graphics to check the quality of the data. The "Quality Metrics" module provides quality metrics of the samples and variables, and visualization of the data matrix. The optional "Coefficient of Variation" arguments allows to flag the variables with a pool CV (or a pool CV over sample CV ratio) above a specific threshold. The advanced "PoolAsPool1" argument is used when correlations with pool dilutions are computed: When set to TRUE (default), samples indicated as "pool" will be considered as "pool1" for the correlation together with the other pool dilutions (e.g. "pool2", "pool4", etc.); otherwise, "pool" samples will not be considered to compute the correlation (this enables the experimenter to have distinct "pool" samples for the computation of CV and "pool1" samples for the computation of dilution). The "sampleMetadata" is returned as output with 3 additional columns containing the p-values for the Hotellings T2 and Z-scores of intensity deciles and proportion of missing values. The "variableMetadata" is returned as output; in case a "sampleType" column is included in the input sampleMetadata file, additional columns will be added to indicate the variable quality metrics (eg mean, sd, CV on "pool", "sample" or "blank", or correlation with pool dilutions, depending on the known type present in the "sampleType" column). A "figure" is generated (pdf file) which illustrates the main computed sample and variable metric values.
  * [checkformat](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ethevenot/checkformat):  [W4M][Metabolomics][LC-MS][GC-MS][NMR] Checks the formats of the dataMatrix, sampleMetadata, and variableMetadata files. For all post-processing steps of the peak table, W4M uses a 3 table format for the data and metadata. This module therefore checks that the formats of the 3 files "dataMatrix.tsv", "sampleMetadata.tsv", and "variableMetadata.tsv" are correct. It can be used before any post-processing step (such as normalization or statistical analysis). Potential warnings or errors in the formats are returned in the "information.txt" output file.
  * [heatmap](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ethevenot/heatmap):  [W4M][Metabolomics][LC-MS][GC-MS][NMR] Heatmap of the data matrix. The heatmap is produced by using the "hclust" hierarchical clustering function from R. By default, the dissimilarity used is "1-correlation" (with the Pearson correlation coefficient), and the Ward agglomeration method. Other distances (e.g., "euclidean") or agglomeration methods (e.g., "average") can be used. For visulization, a scaling argument is suggested by default to enhance contrast (does not modify the clustering computation). Note that computation times for big matrices (e.g. with thousands of features) can be long.
  * [transformation](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ethevenot/transformation): [W4M][Metabolomics][LC-MS][GC-MS][NMR] Transforms the dataMatrix intensity values. The module currently currently performs log2(1+X) and log10(1+X), where X is the data matrix (missing values remain at "NA").
