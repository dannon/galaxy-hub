# Tools

* *From [tambeta](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/tambeta):*
  * [gprofiler](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/tambeta/gprofiler): g:Profiler performs statistical enrichment analysis to provide interpretation to user-provided gene lists, ordered gene lists and chromosomal regions. We study multiple sources of functional evidence, including Gene Ontology terms, biological pathways, regulatory motifs of transcription factors and microRNAs, human disease annotations and protein-protein interactions.

* *From [koen](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/koen):*
  * [gbsx](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/koen/gbsx): GBSX is a package to design inline barcodes for, and to demultiplex GBS and RAD experiments Genotyping by Sequencing is an emerging technology for cost effective variant discovery and genotyping. However, current analysis tools do not fulfill all experimental design and analysis needs. GBSX is a package of tools to first aid in experimental design, including choice of enzymes and barcode design. Secondly, it provides a first analysis step to demultiplex samples using in-line barcodes, providing fastq files that can easily be plugged into existing variant analysis pipelines.

* *From [iuc](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc):*
  * [resize_coordinate_window](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/resize_coordinate_window): Modifies the start and stop coordinates of GFF data, expanding the coordinate window by a specified size. Contains a tool that modifies the start and stop coordinates of GFF data such that the new start and stop position is based on a specified window size that is computed either from the existing start and stop coordinates or centered on the midpoint.

* [data_manager_bowtie_index_builder](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/data_manager_bowtie_index_builder): Data Manager for building bowtie indexes Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million 35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with a Burrows-Wheeler index to keep its memory footprint small: typically about 2.2 GB for the human genome (2.9 GB for paired-end).

* [extract_genomic_dna](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/extract_genomic_dna): Contains a tool that extracts genomic DNA using coordinates from ASSEMBLED genomes and UNassembled genomes.

* *From [bgruening](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening):*
  * [deeptools_plot_correlation](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening/deeptools_plot_correlation): Wrapper for the deepTools: plotCorrelation. deepTools address the challenge of visualizing the large amounts of data that are now routinely generated from sequencing centers in a meaningful way. To do so, deepTools contain useful routines to process the mapped reads data through removal of duplicates and different filtering options to create coverage files in standard bedGraph and bigWig file formats. deepTools allow the creation of normalized coverage files or the comparison between two files (for example, treatment and control). Finally, using such normalized and standardized files, multiple visualizations can be created to identify enrichments with functional annotations of the genome.

  * [translate_bed_sequences](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp/translate_bed_sequences): Perform 3 frame translation of BED file augmented with a sequence column This tool takes an extended (12 column) BED input file that has been processed by the Galaxy tool "Extract Genomic DNA" to add a 13th column with the transcript sequence. It generates a peptide fasta file with the 3-frame translations of the spliced sequence defined by each entry in the input BED file. It can also generate a bed file that defines the mapping of the translations to the reference genome. The tool "Map peptides to a bed file" can use this output to map peptides iidentified from a Proteomics search back to the reference genome.
