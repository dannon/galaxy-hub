  * [apostl_tools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bornea/apostl_tools): APOSTL is an interactive affinity proteomics analysis software developed to reformat affinity proteomics data (both spectral counting and MS1) for input into the SAINTexpress statistical package and to visualize the output(s).

# Tools

* *From [youngkim](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/youngkim):*
  * [ezbamqc](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/youngkim/ezbamqc): Quality control tool for NGS mapping files. ezBAMQC is a tool to check the quality of either one or many mapped next-generation-sequencing datasets. It conducts comprehensive evaluations of aligned sequencing data from multiple aspects including: clipping profile, mapping quality distribution, mapped read length distribution, genomic/transcriptomic mapping distribution, inner distance distribution (for paired-end reads), ribosomal RNA contamination, transcript 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 end bias, transcription dropout rate, sample correlations, sample reproducibility, sample variations. It outputs a set of tables and plots and one HTML page that contains a summary of the results. Many metrics are designed for RNA-seq data specifically, but ezBAMQC can be applied to any mapped sequencing dataset such as RNA-seq, CLIP-seq, GRO-seq, ChIP-seq, DNA-seq and so on.
