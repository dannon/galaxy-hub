# Complex Repository Dependencies

Complex repository dependencies allow many Tool Shed repository installations into a single Galaxy instance where any number of the contained tools across installed repositories can all reference a single installation of a specific tool dependency package (e.g. bwa version 0.5.9).

Describing how this works is tricky, so let's see if we can state it in a way that can be understood: tool dependency definitions that contain repository dependency definitions define a relationship to a tool dependency that will be installed using the instructions in the required repository's **tool_dependencies.xml** file, where the relationship to the required repository is defined by the contained repository dependency definition. Hmmm...okay, let's try to clarify this a bit...

To demonstrate how this works, we'll refer to 2 repositories in the [test Galaxy Tool Shed](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu): [bwa_059](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/greg/bwa_059) and [complex_repository_dependency_on_bwa_059](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/greg/complex_repository_dependency_on_bwa_059).

The [bwa_059](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/greg/bwa_059) repository has type **Tool dependency definition** and contains only a single file named **tool_dependencies.xml** which looks like the following. This definition will download and compile version 0.5.9 of the bwa package.

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <tool_dependency>
        <package name="bwa" version="0.5.9">
            <install version="1.0">
                <actions>
                    <action type="download_by_url">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/bio-bwa/bwa-0.5.9.tar.bz2</action>
                    <action type="shell_command">make clean</action>
                    <action type="shell_command">make</action>
                    <action type="move_file">
                        <source>bwa</source>
                        <destination>$INSTALL_DIR/bin</destination>
                    </action>
                    <action type="set_environment">
                        <environment_variable name="PATH" action="prepend_to">$INSTALL_DIR/bin</environment_variable>
                    </action>
                </actions>
            </install>
            <readme>
    Compiling BWA requires zlib and libpthread to be present on your system.
            </readme>
        </package>
    </tool_dependency>

To demonstrate how the [bwa_059](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/greg/bwa_059) repository can be used, let's take a look at the **tool_dependencies.xml** file contained in the [complex_repository_dependency_on_bwa_059](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/greg/complex_repository_dependency_on_bwa_059 ) repository, which looks like the following.

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <tool_dependency>
        <package name="bwa" version="0.5.9">
            <repository toolshed="http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu" name="bwa_059" owner="greg" changeset_revision="a347750db1d1" />
        </package>
    </tool_dependency>

The above tool dependency definition is associated with the entry in the `<requirements>` tag set defined in the **bwa\_wrapper.xml** Galaxy tool configuration file contained in the same repository. The **bwa\_wrapper.xml** `<requirements>` tag set looks like the following. Notice that the type **package**, version **0.5.9** and name **bwa** match the definition in the above **tool\_dependencies.xml** file.

    <requirements>
        <requirement type="package" version="0.5.9">bwa</requirement>
    </requirements>

Visiting the repository's main page displays various containers. There are two dependencies defined for this repository, both of which are defined in the simple **tool\_dependencies.xml** file above. The repository dependency on revision **a347750db1d1** of the repository named **bwa\_059** owned by **greg** is defined by the ```repository``` tag, while the tool dependency on version **0.5.9** of the **bwa package** is defined by the ```<package>``` tag set.
