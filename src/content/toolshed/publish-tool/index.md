---
## Steps

1. Prepare a correct set of tool files.
1. Create an account on the [Tool Shed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).
1. Create a repository.
1. Upload your tool files.

## Best practices

### Use Planemo

We made the steps above easier to go through by implementing [Planemo](http://planemo.readthedocs.io/) for both [tool development](http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_standalone.html) and [publishing](http://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_writing_publish_intro.html) to the Tool Shed. We **heartily recommend** you use it together with the [best practices](http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html) for Galaxy tool development.

### Follow IUC guidance

The [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](/src/iuc/index.md) maintains a set of [best practices](http://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices/integration_checklist.html) regarding publishing to the Tool Shed.

Last but not least we recommend having only tool per repository.
