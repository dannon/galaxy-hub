 Domains:: **Identify genome region linked to a mutation, and causal candidate mutations** 
 Description:: [RNAmapper](http://www.rnamapper.org/) uses RNA-seq data to identify both a region of the genome linked to a mutation as well as candidate mutations that may be causal for the phenotype of interest.

[RNAmapper](http://www.rnamapper.org/) uses RNA-seq data to identify both a region of the genome linked to a mutation as well as candidate mutations that may be causal for the phenotype of interest. 

From the [RNAmapper home page](http://www.rnamapper.org/):
 RNAmapper uses RNA-seq data to identify both a region of the genome linked to a mutation as well as candidate mutations that may be causal for the phenotype of interest. We have shown that the method can identify mutations that cause nonsense or missense changes to codons, alter transcript splicing, or alter gene expression levels. Here you will find information on how to map your mutations using RNA-Seq data.
