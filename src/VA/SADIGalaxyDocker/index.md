From the [home page](https://mikeleganaaranguren.wordpress.com/2015/01/07/docker-image-for-sadi-galaxy/):

<div class='indent'>

[SADI](http://sadiframework.org/content/about-sadi/) is a framework to define Semantic Web Services that consume and output RDF, and [SADI-Galaxy](https://github.com/mikel-egana-aranguren/SADI-Galaxy) makes SADI services available in the popular Galaxy platform. Thus, SADI-Galaxy is a nice SADI client to invoke SADI services in an environment that Biologists use often.

On the other hand, [Docker](http://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/) is a sort of "virtualisation" environment for deploying applications very easily, without configuration. Therefore I have created a Docker image for deploying a Galaxy instance already containing SADI-Galaxy, so anyone interested in SADI-Galaxy can try it out easily within having to configure Galaxy and SADI-Galaxy.
And then whatever information you want to include here.  This can describe the virtual appliance in some detail, or just provide a link to the virtual appliance and any advice/guidance on how to use it.

The home page also contains instructions on how to install and use the instance,
