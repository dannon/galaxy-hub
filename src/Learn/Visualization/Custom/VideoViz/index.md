In the modern world of imaging and microscopy, data is more than just sam, bam, and fastq files. This plugin allows videos to be viewed within galaxy, stepping through them frame-by-frame or playing them normally. Additionally we use the speed plugin for faster or slower playback.

## Needed Tools

List of tools required:

* Requires [Mp4 datatype](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/eric-rasche/video_datatypes) from toolshed.

## Datasets

Any mp4 video file uploaded may be viewed through the visualization "Video". Currently you will manually have to specify that the dataset is an mp4 file, otherwise it's detected as a binary file.

## Links

Links to any useful datasets or information.
