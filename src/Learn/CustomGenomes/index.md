# What is a "Custom Reference Genome" ?

A reference genome contains the nucleotide sequence of the chromosomes, scaffolds, or contigs for a single species, representative of a specific genome build or release. 

In [Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org), a ** *custom* reference genome** is a [FASTA](/Learn/Datatypes#fasta) formatted [dataset](/Learn#datasets) that can be used in place of a ** *native* reference genome** with most tools. 
* **custom**: a dataset *from the history* loaded by users
* **native**: *local* or *cached* by administrators (see [/Admin/DataPreparation](/src/Admin/DataPreparation/index.md))

# Overview
There are **three basic steps** to using a *Custom Reference Genome*:
* obtain a **[FASTA](/Learn/Datatypes#fasta) copy of the target genome**
* **[FTP](/FTPUpload) the genome to Galaxy** and load into a history as a [dataset](/Learn#datasets)
* **set a tool form's options to use a custom reference genome from the history** and select the loaded genome

# Sources
* UCSC, Ensembl, NCBI/GenBank
* Other Research project associated with specific genome projects
* Internal research projects
* Selected genomes can be found in "Data Libraries" on [/Main](/Main) for use at [http://usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org). Example: **hg19** is available for GATK under that sub-directory.
<br />
# Format
* Custom Genomes are required to be in [FASTA](/Learn/Datatypes#fasta) format
* The data should be formatted as [FASTA](/Learn/Datatypes#fasta) prior to upload into Galaxy
* The dataset will need to be labeled as [FASTA](/Learn/Datatypes#fasta) after loaded (if not automatically assigned)
<br />
# Custom Builds
Some tools and functions require that the ['database' attribute is assigned](/Support#tool_doesn27t_recognize_dataset) or that a Custom Reference Genome is set up as a *Custom Build* prior to use. Examples are the tool **Extract Genomic DNA**, certain **Picard** tools, and the function **Visualization**. 

Once created, a *Custom Build* is added to the list **Database/Build:** on the dataset 'Edit Attributes' and 'Upload File' tool forms and is available for 'Visualizations'. These can be assigned or used just like any other reference genome. 

* Start with an existing fasta Custom Reference Genome in your history
* Go to the top "User" menu and select "Custom Builds"
* Enter in the labels (no spaces and no special characters other than "_")
* Select the fasta Custom Reference Genome
* Submit and wait for the build to finish loading before assigning to a dataset or using to start a new Visualization 
* Note: It is fine to navigate away from this form and come back to it later to check for status. The larger the fasta file and busier the Galaxy instance is, the longer the processing will take.

# Sorting
Many tool expect that reference genomes are sorted in [lexicographical order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order). These tools are often downstream of the initial mapping tools, which means that a large investment in a project has already been made (i.e. a long mapping process), before a problem with sorting pops up in conclusion layer tools. No one likes to start over!

How to avoid? Always sort your [FASTA](/Learn/Datatypes#fasta) reference genome dataset at the beginning of a project. Many sources only provide sorted genomes, but double checking is your own responsibility, and super easy in Galaxy. So easy that there isn't even a shared workflow, just a recipe (but feel free to make your own):

quick lexicographical sort recipe:

```
1. Convert Formats -> FASTA-to-Tabular
2. Filter and Sort -> Sort
       on column: c1 
       with flavor: Alphabetical
       everything in: Ascending order
3. Convert Formats -> Tabular-to-FASTA
```


The above sorting method is for most tools, but not all. In particular, GATK tools have a tool-specific sort order requirement. The [Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) FAQ with input format instructions is **[here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gark/guide/article?id=1204)**.

# Troubleshooting
If a custom genome dataset is producing errors, clicking on the green bug icon ![](/Images/Icons/bug.png) will often provide a description of the problem. This does not automatically submit a bug report, and it is not always necessary to do so, but it is a good way to get more information about why a job is failing

Common problems and solutions:

**A problem or not a problem?**
Certain job errors with RNA-seq tools can at first appear to look like a format problem with a custom reference genome, but are actually a bit more complicated...
* Cufflinks/merge/diff reports a missing/problem transcripts.gtf file. This generally indicates a mismatch in the chromosome identifiers between the reference genome used for the original (Tophat) alignment, the reference annotation GTF data, and the reference genome. 
* The problem can sometimes be corrected by altering the chromosome identifiers in the GTF file or the reference genome (see the RNA-seq FAQ: http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/u/jeremy/p/transcriptome-analysis-faq).
* A quick solution is to not use the GTF file and/or to turn off the *bias correction* option on the tool form.
* The best solution is to use the same exact reference genome for all steps in the same analysis pipeline. Alignment tools (BWA, Bowtie, Tophat) are generally tolerant of minor formatting problems with reference genomes. However, downstream tools tend to have more stringent format requirements. To avoid having to reprocess, a best practice is to verify that the formatting is correct before any steps are started.
