<div class='noteItemHeader'>[Should we use spaces in title or not to have the best links](/Note/Ssmple How to do this cool thing)</div>

Opps, that was the mistake I made. Links vs title. Link - no spaces. Link label - anything.

This will be some text *describing what this is about*. Then maybe a few bullet points:

* this one
* and ** wow**

[<Screencast>](/screencast/fake) link.

Graphics:

This page is of course just **brief** - 10 lines max. It should point to the primary wiki with the main content.
