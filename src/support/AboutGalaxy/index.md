## Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research.
<br />
**[Galaxy](../../FrontPage)**'s goal is to be *accessible*, *reproducible*, and *transparent*. 
* **Accessible:** Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters and run tools and workflows.
* **Reproducible:** Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis.
* **Transparent:** Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages, interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.

There are many [Choices](/BigPicture/Choices) when you want to learn more **[about using Galaxy](../../Support/AboutGalaxy)**!

In addition to using the [public Galaxy server](http://usegalaxy.org), you can also install your [own instance of Galaxy](/Admin/GetGalaxy), or create an [instance of Galaxy on the cloud using CloudMan](/CloudMan) and explore all [/Cloud](/Cloud) resources.  Another option is to use one of the ever-increasing number of [/Public Galaxy Servers](/Public Galaxy Servers) hosted by other organizations. And if you or your lab is looking to run their own local instance that is "ready-to-go", learn more about the [Slipstream Appliance: Galaxy Edition](http://www.bioteam.net/slipstream/galaxy-edition).

The GALAXY Framework at the highest level is a set of reusable software components. Learn more about [Galaxy's Architecture](/Admin/Internals/Implementation Info).
